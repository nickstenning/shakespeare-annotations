If I should take<br />a displeasure against you, look you,--<br /><br />TRINCULO <br />Thou wert but a lost monster.<br /><br />CALIBAN <br />Good my lord, give me thy favour still.<br />Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to<br />Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.<br />All's hush'd as midnight yet.<br /><br />TRINCULO <br />Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,--<br /><br />STEPHANO <br />There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that,<br />monster, but an infinite loss.<br /><br />TRINCULO <br />That's more to me than my wetting: yet this is your<br />harmless fairy, monster.<br /><br />STEPHANO <br />I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er ears<br />for my labour.<br /><br />CALIBAN <br />Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,<br />This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter.<br />Do that good mischief which may make this island<br />Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,<br />For aye thy foot-licker.<br /><br />STEPHANO <br />Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.<br /><br />TRINCULO <br />O king Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! look<br />what a wardrobe here is for thee!<br /><br />CALIBAN <br />Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.<br /><br />TRINCULO <br />O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery.<br />O king Stephano!<br /><br />STEPHANO <br />Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll have<br />that gown.<br /><br />TRINCULO <br />Thy grace shall have it.<br /><br />CALIBAN <br />The dropsy drown this fool I what do you mean<br />To dote thus on such luggage? Let's alone<br />And do the murder first: if he awake,<br />From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches,<br />Make us strange stuff.<br /><br />STEPHANO <br />Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line,<br />is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under<br />the line: now, jerkin, you are like to lose your<br />hair and prove a bald jerkin.<br /><br />TRINCULO <br />Do, do: we steal by line and level, an't like your grace.<br /><br />STEPHANO <br />I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment for't:<br />wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this<br />country. 'Steal by line and level' is an excellent<br />pass of pate; there's another garment for't.<br /><br />TRINCULO <br />Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and<br />away with the rest.<br /><br />CALIBAN <br />I will have none on't: we shall lose our time,<br />And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes<br />With foreheads villanous low.<br /><br />STEPHANO <br />Monster, lay-to your fingers: help to bear this<br />away where my hogshead of wine is, or I'll turn you<br />out of my kingdom: go to, carry this.<br /><br />TRINCULO <br />And this.<br /><br />STEPHANO <br />Ay, and this.<br /><br />A noise of hunters heard. Enter divers Spirits, in shape of dogs and hounds, and hunt them about, PROSPERO and ARIEL setting them on<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />Hey, Mountain, hey!<br /><br />ARIEL <br />Silver I there it goes, Silver!<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />Fury, Fury! there, Tyrant, there! hark! hark!<br /><br />CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, are driven out<br /><br />Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints<br />With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews<br />With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them<br />Than pard or cat o' mountain.<br /><br />ARIEL <br />Hark, they roar!<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour<br />Lie at my mercy all mine enemies:<br />Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou<br />Shalt have the air at freedom: for a little<br />Follow, and do me service.<br /><br />Exeunt<br /><br /><br /><br /></span><span id = 345 ></span><span id = 346 >Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes, and ARIEL <br />PROSPERO <br />Now does my project gather to a head:<br />My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time<br />Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?<br /><br />ARIEL <br />On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,<br />You said our work should cease.<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />I did say so,<br />When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,<br />How fares the king and's followers?<br /><br />ARIEL <br />Confined together<br />In the same fashion as you gave in charge,<br />Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,<br />In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;<br />They cannot budge till your release. The king,<br />His brother and yours, abide all three distracted<br />And the remainder mourning over them,<br />Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly<br />Him that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo;'<br />His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops<br />From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em<br />That if you now beheld them, your affections<br />Would become tender.<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />Dost thou think so, spirit?<br /><br />ARIEL <br />Mine would, sir, were I human.<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />And mine shall.<br />Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling<br />Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,<br />One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,<br />Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?<br />Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,<br />Yet with my nobler reason 'gaitist my fury<br />Do I take part: the rarer action is<br />In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,<br />The sole drift of my purpose doth extend<br />Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:<br />My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,<br />And they shall be themselves.<br /><br />ARIEL <br />I'll fetch them, sir.<br /><br />Exit<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,<br />And ye that on the sands with printless foot<br />Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him<br />When he comes back; you demi-puppets that<br />By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,<br />Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime<br />Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice<br />To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,<br />Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd<br />The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,<br />And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault<br />Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder<br />Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak<br />With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory<br />Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up<br />The pine and cedar: graves at my command<br />Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth<br />By my so potent art. But this rough magic<br />I here abjure, and, when I have required<br />Some heavenly music, which even now I do,<br />To work mine end upon their senses that<br />This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,<br />Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,<br />And deeper than did ever plummet sound<br />I'll drown my book.<br /><br />Solemn music<br /><br />Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO; SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner, attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO they all enter the circle which PROSPERO had made, and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO observing, speaks:<br /><br />A solemn air and the best comforter<br />To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,<br />Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,<br />For you are spell-stopp'd.<br />Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,<br />Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,<br />Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,<br />And as the morning steals upon the night,<br />Melting the darkness, so their rising senses<br />Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle<br />Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,<br />My true preserver, and a loyal sir<br />To him you follow'st! I will pay thy graces<br />Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly<br />Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:<br />Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.<br />Thou art pinch'd fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,<br />You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,<br />Expell'd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,<br />Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,<br />Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee,<br />Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding<br />Begins to swell, and the approaching tide<br />Will shortly fill the reasonable shore<br />That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them<br />That yet looks on me, or would know me Ariel,<br />Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:<br />I will discase me, and myself present<br />As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;<br />Thou shalt ere long be free.<br /><br />ARIEL sings and helps to attire him<br /><br />Where the bee sucks. there suck I:<br />In a cowslip's bell I lie;<br />There I couch when owls do cry.<br />On the bat's back I do fly<br />After summer merrily.<br />Merrily, merrily shall I live now<br />Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee:<br />But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.<br />To the king's ship, invisible as thou art:<br />There shalt thou find the mariners asleep<br />Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain<br />Being awake, enforce them to this place,<br />And presently, I prithee.<br /><br />ARIEL <br />I drink the air before me, and return<br />Or ere your pulse twice beat.<br /><br />Exit<br /><br />GONZALO <br />All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement<br />Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us<br />Out of this fearful country!<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />Behold, sir king,<br />The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:<br />For more assurance that a living prince<br />Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;<br />And to thee and thy company I bid<br />A hearty welcome.<br /><br />ALONSO <br />Whether thou best he or no,<br />Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,<br />As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse<br />Beats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,<br />The affliction of my mind amends, with which,<br />I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,<br />An if this be at all, a most strange story.<br />Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat<br />Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero<br />Be living and be here?<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />First, noble friend,<br />Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot<br />Be measured or confined.<br /><br />GONZALO <br />Whether this be<br />Or be not, I'll not swear.<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />You do yet taste<br />Some subtilties o' the isle, that will not let you<br />Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!<br /><br />Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO<br /><br />But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,<br />I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you<br />And justify you traitors: at this time<br />I will tell no tales.<br /><br />SEBASTIAN <br />[Aside] The devil speaks in him.<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />No.<br />For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother<br />Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive<br />Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require<br />My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,<br />Thou must restore.<br /><br />ALONSO <br />If thou be'st Prospero,<br />Give us particulars of thy preservation;<br />How thou hast met us here, who three hours since<br />Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost--<br />How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--<br />My dear son Ferdinand.<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />I am woe for't, sir.<br /><br />ALONSO <br />Irreparable is the loss, and patience<br />Says it is past her cure.<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />I rather think<br />You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace<br />For the like loss I have her sovereign aid<br />And rest myself content.<br /><br />ALONSO <br />You the like loss!<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />As great to me as late; and, supportable<br />To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker<br />Than you may call to comfort you, for I<br />Have lost my daughter.<br /><br />ALONSO <br />A daughter?<br />O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,<br />The king and queen there! that they were, I wish<br />Myself were mudded in that oozy bed<br />Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />In this last tempest. I perceive these lords<br />At this encounter do so much admire<br />That they devour their reason and scarce think<br />Their eyes do offices of truth, their words<br />Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have<br />Been justled from your senses, know for certain<br />That I am Prospero and that very duke<br />Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely<br />Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,<br />To be the lord on't. No more yet of this;<br />For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,<br />Not a relation for a breakfast nor<br />Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;<br />This cell's my court: here have I few attendants<br />And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.<br />My dukedom since you have given me again,<br />I will requite you with as good a thing;<br />At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye<br />As much as me my dukedom.<br /><br />Here PROSPERO discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA playing at chess<br /><br />MIRANDA <br />Sweet lord, you play me false.<br /><br />FERDINAND <br />No, my dear'st love,<br />I would not for the world.<br /><br />MIRANDA <br />Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,<br />And I would call it, fair play.<br /><br />ALONSO <br />If this prove<br />A vision of the Island, one dear son<br />Shall I twice lose.<br /><br />SEBASTIAN <br />A most high miracle!<br /><br />FERDINAND <br />Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;<br />I have cursed them without cause.<br /><br />Kneels<br /><br />ALONSO <br />Now all the blessings<br />Of a glad father compass thee about!<br />Arise, and say how thou camest here.<br /><br />MIRANDA <br />O, wonder!<br />How many goodly creatures are there here!<br />How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,<br />That has such people in't!<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />'Tis new to thee.<br /><br />ALONSO <br />What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?<br />Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:<br />Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,<br />And brought us thus together?<br /><br />FERDINAND <br />Sir, she is mortal;<br />But by immortal Providence she's mine:<br />I chose her when I could not ask my father<br />For his advice, nor thought I had one. She<br />Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,<br />Of whom so often I have heard renown,<br />But never saw before; of whom I have<br />Received a second life; and second father<br />This lady makes him to me.<br /><br />ALONSO <br />I am hers:<br />But, O, how oddly will it sound that I<br />Must ask my child forgiveness!<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />There, sir, stop:<br />Let us not burthen our remembrance with<br />A heaviness that's gone.<br /><br />GONZALO <br />I have inly wept,<br />Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you god,<br />And on this couple drop a blessed crown!<br />For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way<br />Which brought us hither.<br /><br />ALONSO <br />I say, Amen, Gonzalo!<br /><br />GONZALO <br />Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue<br />Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice<br />Beyond a common joy, and set it down<br />With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage<br />Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,<br />And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife<br />Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom<br />In a poor isle and all of us ourselves<br />When no man was his own.<br /><br />ALONSO <br />[To FERDINAND and MIRANDA] Give me your hands:<br />Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart<br />That doth not wish you joy!<br /><br />GONZALO <br />Be it so! Amen!<br /><br />Re-enter ARIEL, with the Master and Boatswain amazedly following<br /><br />O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:<br />I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,<br />This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,<br />That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?<br />Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?<br /><br />Boatswain <br />The best news is, that we have safely found<br />Our king and company; the next, our ship--<br />Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split--<br />Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when<br />We first put out to sea.<br /><br />ARIEL <br />[Aside to PROSPERO] Sir, all this service<br />Have I done since I went.<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />[Aside to ARIEL] My tricksy spirit!<br /><br />ALONSO <br />These are not natural events; they strengthen<br />From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?<br /><br />Boatswain <br />If I did think, sir, I were well awake,<br />I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,<br />And--how we know not--all clapp'd under hatches;<br />Where but even now with strange and several noises<br />Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,<br />And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,<br />We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;<br />Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld<br />Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master<br />Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,<br />Even in a dream, were we divided from them<br />And were brought moping hither.<br /><br />ARIEL <br />[Aside to PROSPERO] Was't well done?<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />[Aside to ARIEL] Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.<br /><br />ALONSO <br />This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod<br />And there is in this business more than nature<br />Was ever conduct of: some oracle<br />Must rectify our knowledge.<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />Sir, my liege,<br />Do not infest your mind with beating on<br />The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure<br />Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,<br />Which to you shall seem probable, of every<br />These happen'd accidents; till when, be cheerful<br />And think of each thing well.<br /><br />Aside to ARIEL<br /><br />Come hither, spirit:<br />Set Caliban and his companions free;<br />Untie the spell.<br /><br />Exit ARIEL<br /><br />How fares my gracious sir?<br />There are yet missing of your company<br />Some few odd lads that you remember not.<br /><br />Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO and TRINCULO, in their stolen apparel<br /><br />STEPHANO <br />Every man shift for all the rest, and<br />let no man take care for himself; for all is<br />but fortune. Coragio, bully-monster, coragio!<br /><br />TRINCULO <br />If these be true spies which I wear in my head,<br />here's a goodly sight.<br /><br />CALIBAN <br />O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!<br />How fine my master is! I am afraid<br />He will chastise me.<br /><br />SEBASTIAN <br />Ha, ha!<br />What things are these, my lord Antonio?<br />Will money buy 'em?<br /><br />ANTONIO <br />Very like; one of them<br />Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,<br />Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,<br />His mother was a witch, and one so strong<br />That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,<br />And deal in her command without her power.<br />These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil--<br />For he's a bastard one--had plotted with them<br />To take my life. Two of these fellows you<br />Must know and own; this thing of darkness!<br />Acknowledge mine.<br /><br />CALIBAN <br />I shall be pinch'd to death.<br /><br />ALONSO <br />Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?<br /><br />SEBASTIAN <br />He is drunk now: where had he wine?<br /><br />ALONSO <br />And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they<br />Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?<br />How camest thou in this pickle?<br /><br />TRINCULO <br />I have been in such a pickle since I<br />saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of<br />my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.<br /><br />SEBASTIAN <br />Why, how now, Stephano!<br /><br />STEPHANO <br />O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a cramp.<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />You'ld be king o' the isle, sirrah?<br /><br />STEPHANO <br />I should have been a sore one then.<br /><br />ALONSO <br />This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.<br /><br />Pointing to Caliban<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />He is as disproportion'd in his manners<br />As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;<br />Take with you your companions; as you look<br />To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.<br /><br />CALIBAN <br />Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter<br />And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass<br />Was I, to take this drunkard for a god<br />And worship this dull fool!<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />Go to; away!<br /><br />ALONSO <br />Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.<br /><br />SEBASTIAN <br />Or stole it, rather.<br /><br />Exeunt CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />Sir, I invite your highness and your train<br />To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest<br />For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste<br />With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it<br />Go quick away; the story of my life<br />And the particular accidents gone by<br />Since I came to this isle: and in the morn<br />I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,<br />Where I have hope to see the nuptial<br />Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;<br />And thence retire me to my Milan, where<br />Every third thought shall be my grave.<br /><br />ALONSO <br />I long<br />To hear the story of your life, which must<br />Take the ear strangely.<br /><br />PROSPERO <br />I'll deliver all;<br />And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales<br />And sail so expeditious that shall catch<br />Your royal fleet far off.<br /><br />Aside to ARIEL<br /><br />My Ariel, chick,<br />That is thy charge: then to the elements<br />Be free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near.<br /><br />Exeunt<br /><br />EPILOGUE<br />SPOKEN BY PROSPERO<br />Now my charms are all o'erthrown,<br />And what strength I have's mine own,<br />Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,<br />I must be here confined by you,<br />Or sent to Naples. Let me not,<br />Since I have my dukedom got<br />And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell<br />In this bare island by your spell;<br />But release me from my bands<br />With the help of your good hands:<br />Gentle breath of yours my sails<br />Must fill, or else my project fails,<br />Which was to please. Now I want<br />Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,<br />And my ending is despair,<br />Unless I be relieved by prayer,<br />Which pierces so that it assaults<br />Mercy itself and frees all faults.<br />As you from crimes would pardon'd be,<br />Let your indulgence set me free.<br /><br /><br /></span>
