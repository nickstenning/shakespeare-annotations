Why, this was quite forgot.</p><p>BIRON <br />So study evermore is overshot:<br />While it doth study to have what it would<br />It doth forget to do the thing it should,<br />And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,<br />'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.</p><p>FERDINAND <br />We must of force dispense with this decree;<br />She must lie here on mere necessity.</p><p>BIRON <br />Necessity will make us all forsworn<br />Three thousand times within this three years' space;<br />For every man with his affects is born,<br />Not by might master'd but by special grace:<br />If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;<br />I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'<br />So to the laws at large I write my name:</p><p>Subscribes</p><p>And he that breaks them in the least degree<br />Stands in attainder of eternal shame:<br />Suggestions are to other as to me;<br />But I believe, although I seem so loath,<br />I am the last that will last keep his oath.<br />But is there no quick recreation granted?</p><p>FERDINAND <br />Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted<br />With a refined traveller of Spain;<br />A man in all the world's new fashion planted,<br />That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;<br />One whom the music of his own vain tongue<br />Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;<br />A man of complements, whom right and wrong<br />Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:<br />This child of fancy, that Armado hight,<br />For interim to our studies shall relate<br />In high-born words the worth of many a knight<br />From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.<br />How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;<br />But, I protest, I love to hear him lie<br />And I will use him for my minstrelsy.</p><p>BIRON <br />Armado is a most illustrious wight,<br />A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.</p><p>LONGAVILLE <br />Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;<br />And so to study, three years is but short.</p><p>Enter DULL with a letter, and COSTARD</p><p>DULL <br />Which is the duke's own person?</p><p>BIRON <br />This, fellow: what wouldst?</p><p>DULL <br />I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his<br />grace's tharborough: but I would see his own person<br />in flesh and blood.</p><p>BIRON <br />This is he.</p><p>DULL <br />Signior Arme--Arme--commends you.

Now, sir, for the manner,--it is the<br />manner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form,--<br />in some form.</p><p>BIRON <br />For the following, sir?</p><p>COSTARD <br />As it shall follow in my correction: and God defend<br />the right!</p><p>FERDINAND <br />Will you hear this letter with attention?</p><p>BIRON <br />As we would hear an oracle.</p><p>COSTARD <br />Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.</p><p>FERDINAND <br />[Reads] 'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and<br />sole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god,<br />and body's fostering patron.'</p><p>COSTARD <br />Not a word of Costard yet.</p><p>FERDINAND <br />[Reads] 'So it is,'--</p><p>COSTARD <br />It may be so: but if he say it is so, he is, in<br />telling true, but so.</p><p>FERDINAND <br />Peace!</p><p>COSTARD <br />Be to me and every man that dares not fight!</p><p>FERDINAND <br />No words!</p><p>COSTARD <br />Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.</p><p>FERDINAND <br />[Reads] 'So it is, besieged with sable-coloured<br />melancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humour<br />to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving<br />air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to<br />walk.

If drawing my sword against the humour<br />of affection would deliver me from the reprobate<br />thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and<br />ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised<br />courtesy.

I shall be forsworn, which<br />is a great argument of falsehood, if I love. And<br />how can that be true love which is falsely<br />attempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil:<br />there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so<br />tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was<br />Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.<br />Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club;<br />and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier.<br />The first and second cause will not serve my turn;<br />the passado he respects not, the duello he regards<br />not: his disgrace is to be called boy; but his<br />glory is to subdue men. Adieu, valour! rust rapier!<br />be still, drum! for your manager is in love; yea,<br />he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme,<br />for I am sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise, wit;<br />write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.</p><p>Exit</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span><span id = 2084 ></span><span id = 2085 ><p>SCENE I.

The same.</p><p>Enter the PRINCESS, KATHARINE, ROSALINE, and MARIA <br />PRINCESS <br />Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,<br />If fairings come thus plentifully in:<br />A lady wall'd about with diamonds!<br />Look you what I have from the loving king.</p><p>ROSALINE <br />Madame, came nothing else along with that?</p><p>PRINCESS <br />Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme<br />As would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper,<br />Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all,<br />That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.</p><p>ROSALINE <br />That was the way to make his godhead wax,<br />For he hath been five thousand years a boy.</p><p>KATHARINE <br />Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.</p><p>ROSALINE <br />You'll ne'er be friends with him; a' kill'd your sister.</p><p>KATHARINE <br />He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;<br />And so she died: had she been light, like you,<br />Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,<br />She might ha' been a grandam ere she died:<br />And so may you; for a light heart lives long.</p><p>ROSALINE <br />What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?</p><p>KATHARINE <br />A light condition in a beauty dark.</p><p>ROSALINE <br />We need more light to find your meaning out.</p><p>KATHARINE <br />You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;<br />Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.</p><p>ROSALINE <br />Look what you do, you do it still i' the dark.</p><p>KATHARINE <br />So do not you, for you are a light wench.</p><p>ROSALINE <br />Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.</p><p>KATHARINE <br />You weigh me not?

Nay, you must do it soon.</p><p>Music plays</p><p>Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.</p><p>FERDINAND <br />Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?</p><p>ROSALINE <br />You took the moon at full, but now she's changed.</p><p>FERDINAND <br />Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.<br />The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.</p><p>ROSALINE <br />Our ears vouchsafe it.</p><p>FERDINAND <br />But your legs should do it.</p><p>ROSALINE <br />Since you are strangers and come here by chance,<br />We'll not be nice: take hands.
