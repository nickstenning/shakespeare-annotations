Before LEONATO'S house.</h3><blockquote><i>Enter LEONATO, HERO, and BEATRICE, with a Messenger</i></blockquote><a><b>LEONATO</b></a><blockquote><a>I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon</a><br /><a>comes this night to Messina.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>Messenger</b></a><blockquote><a>He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off</a><br /><a>when I left him.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LEONATO</b></a><blockquote><a>How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>Messenger</b></a><blockquote><a>But few of any sort, and none of name.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LEONATO</b></a><blockquote><a>A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings</a><br /><a>home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath</a><br /><a>bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>Messenger</b></a><blockquote><a>Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by</a><br /><a>Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the</a><br /><a>promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,</a><br /><a>the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better</a><br /><a>bettered expectation than you must expect of me to</a><br /><a>tell you how.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LEONATO</b></a><blockquote><a>He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much</a><br /><a>glad of it.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>Messenger</b></a><blockquote><a>I have already delivered him letters, and there</a><br /><a>appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could</a><br /><a>not show itself modest enough without a badge of</a><br /><a>bitterness.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LEONATO</b></a><blockquote><a>Did he break out into tears?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>Messenger</b></a><blockquote><a>In great measure.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LEONATO</b></a><blockquote><a>A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces</a><br /><a>truer than those that are so washed. How much</a><br /><a>better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BEATRICE</b></a><blockquote><a>I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the</a><br /><a>wars or no?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>Messenger</b></a><blockquote><a>I know none of that name, lady: there was none such</a><br /><a>in the army of any sort.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LEONATO</b></a><blockquote><a>What is he that you ask for, niece?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>HERO</b></a><blockquote><a>My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>Messenger</b></a><blockquote><a>O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BEATRICE</b></a><blockquote><a>He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged</a><br /><a>Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading</a><br /><a>the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged</a><br /><a>him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he</a><br /><a>killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath</a><br /><a>he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LEONATO</b></a><blockquote><a>Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;</a><br /><a>but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>Messenger</b></a><blockquote><a>He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BEATRICE</b></a><blockquote><a>You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:</a><br /><a>he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an</a><br /><a>excellent stomach.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>Messenger</b></a><blockquote><a>And a good soldier too, lady.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BEATRICE</b></a><blockquote><a>And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>Messenger</b></a><blockquote><a>A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all</a><br /><a>honourable virtues.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BEATRICE</b></a><blockquote><a>It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:</a><br /><a>but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LEONATO</b></a><blockquote><a>You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a</a><br /><a>kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:</a><br /><a>they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit</a><br /><a>between them.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BEATRICE</b></a><blockquote><a>Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last</a><br /><a>conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and</a><br /><a>now is the whole man governed with one: so that if</a><br /><a>he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him</a><br /><a>bear it for a difference between himself and his</a><br /><a>horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,</a><br /><a>to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his</a><br /><a>companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>Messenger</b></a><blockquote><a>Is't possible?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BEATRICE</b></a><blockquote><a>Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as</a><br /><a>the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the</a><br /><a>next block.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>Messenger</b></a><blockquote><a>I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BEATRICE</b></a><blockquote><a>No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray</a><br /><a>you, who is his companion? Is there no young</a><br /><a>squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>Messenger</b></a><blockquote><a>He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BEATRICE</b></a><blockquote><a>O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he</a><br /><a>is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker</a><br /><a>runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if</a><br /><a>he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a</a><br /><a>thousand pound ere a' be cured.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>Messenger</b></a><blockquote><a>I will hold friends with you, lady.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BEATRICE</b></a><blockquote><a>Do, good friend.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LEONATO</b></a><blockquote><a>You will never run mad, niece.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BEATRICE</b></a><blockquote><a>No, not till a hot January.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>Messenger</b></a><blockquote><a>Don Pedro is approached.</a><br /><p><i>Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and BALTHASAR</i></p></blockquote><a><b>DON PEDRO</b></a><blockquote><a>Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your</a><br /><a>trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid</a><br /><a>cost, and you encounter it.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LEONATO</b></a><blockquote><a>Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of</a><br /><a>your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should</a><br /><a>remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides</a><br /><a>and happiness takes his leave.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>DON PEDRO</b></a><blockquote><a>You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this</a><br /><a>is your daughter.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LEONATO</b></a><blockquote><a>Her mother hath many times told me so.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BENEDICK</b></a><blockquote><a>Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LEONATO</b></a><blockquote><a>Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>DON PEDRO</b></a><blockquote><a>You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this</a><br /><a>what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers</a><br /><a>herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an</a><br /><a>honourable father.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BENEDICK</b></a><blockquote><a>If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not</a><br /><a>have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as</a><br /><a>like him as she is.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BEATRICE</b></a><blockquote><a>I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior</a><br /><a>Benedick: nobody marks you.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BENEDICK</b></a><blockquote><a>What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BEATRICE</b></a><blockquote><a>Is it possible disdain should die while she hath</a><br /><a>such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?</a><br /><a>Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come</a><br /><a>in her presence.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BENEDICK</b></a><blockquote><a>Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I</a><br /><a>am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I</a><br /><a>would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard</a><br /><a>heart; for, truly, I love none.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BEATRICE</b></a><blockquote><a>A dear happiness to women: they would else have</a><br /><a>been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God</a><br /><a>and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I</a><br /><a>had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man</a><br /><a>swear he loves me.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BENEDICK</b></a><blockquote><a>God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some</a><br /><a>gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate</a><br /><a>scratched face.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BEATRICE</b></a><blockquote><a>Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such</a><br /><a>a face as yours were.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BENEDICK</b></a><blockquote><a>Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BEATRICE</b></a><blockquote><a>A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BENEDICK</b></a><blockquote><a>I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and</a><br /><a>so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's</a><br /><a>name; I have done.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BEATRICE</b></a><blockquote><a>You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>DON PEDRO</b></a><blockquote><a>That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio</a><br /><a>and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath</a><br /><a>invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at</a><br /><a>the least a month; and he heartily prays some</a><br /><a>occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no</a><br /><a>hypocrite, but prays from his heart.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LEONATO</b></a><blockquote><a>If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.</a><br /><p><i>To DON JOHN</i></p><a>Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to</a><br /><a>the prince your brother, I owe you all duty.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>DON JOHN</b></a><blockquote><a>I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank</a><br /><a>you.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LEONATO</b></a><blockquote><a>Please it your grace lead on?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>DON PEDRO</b></a><blockquote><a>Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.</a><br /><p><i>Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIO</i></p></blockquote><a><b>CLAUDIO</b></a><blockquote><a>Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BENEDICK</b></a><blockquote><a>I noted her not; but I looked on her.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CLAUDIO</b></a><blockquote><a>Is she not a modest young lady?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BENEDICK</b></a><blockquote><a>Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for</a><br /><a>my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak</a><br /><a>after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CLAUDIO</b></a><blockquote><a>No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BENEDICK</b></a><blockquote><a>Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high</a><br /><a>praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little</a><br /><a>for a great praise: only this commendation I can</a><br /><a>afford her, that were she other than she is, she</a><br /><a>were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, I</a><br /><a>do not like her.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CLAUDIO</b></a><blockquote><a>Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me</a><br /><a>truly how thou likest her.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BENEDICK</b></a><blockquote><a>Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CLAUDIO</b></a><blockquote><a>Can the world buy such a jewel?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BENEDICK</b></a><blockquote><a>Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this</a><br /><a>with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,</a><br /><a>to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a</a><br /><a>rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take</a><br /><a>you, to go in the song?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CLAUDIO</b></a><blockquote><a>In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I</a><br /><a>looked on.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BENEDICK</b></a><blockquote><a>I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such</a><br /><a>matter: there's her cousin, an she were not</a><br /><a>possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty</a><br /><a>as the first of May doth the last of December. But I</a><br /><a>hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CLAUDIO</b></a><blockquote><a>I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the</a><br /><a>contrary, if Hero would be my wife.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BENEDICK</b></a><blockquote><a>Is't come to this? In faith, hath not the world</a><br /><a>one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?</a><br /><a>Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?</a><br /><a>Go to, i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck</a><br /><a>into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away</a><br /><a>Sundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.</a><br /><p><i>Re-enter DON PEDRO</i></p></blockquote><a><b>DON PEDRO</b></a><blockquote><a>What secret hath held you here, that you followed</a><br /><a>not to Leonato's?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BENEDICK</b></a><blockquote><a>I would your grace would constrain me to tell.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>DON PEDRO</b></a><blockquote><a>I charge thee on thy allegiance.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BENEDICK</b></a><blockquote><a>You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb</a><br /><a>man; I would have you think so; but, on my</a><br /><a>allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance. He is</a><br /><a>in love. With who? now that is your grace's part.</a><br /><a>Mark how short his answer is;--With Hero, Leonato's</a><br /><a>short daughter.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CLAUDIO</b></a><blockquote><a>If this were so, so were it uttered.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BENEDICK</b></a><blockquote><a>Like the old tale, my lord: 'it is not so, nor</a><br /><a>'twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be</a><br /><a>so.'</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CLAUDIO</b></a><blockquote><a>If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it</a><br /><a>should be otherwise.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>DON PEDRO</b></a><blockquote><a>Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CLAUDIO</b></a><blockquote><a>You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>DON PEDRO</b></a><blockquote><a>By my troth, I speak my thought.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CLAUDIO</b></a><blockquote><a>And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BENEDICK</b></a><blockquote><a>And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CLAUDIO</b></a><blockquote><a>That I love her, I feel.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>DON PEDRO</b></a><blockquote><a>That she is worthy, I know.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BENEDICK</b></a><blockquote><a>That I neither feel how she should be loved nor</a><br /><a>know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that</a><br /><a>fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>DON PEDRO</b></a><blockquote><a>Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite</a><br /><a>of beauty.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CLAUDIO</b></a><blockquote><a>And never could maintain his part but in the force</a><br /><a>of his will.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BENEDICK</b></a><blockquote><a>That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she</a><br /><a>brought me up, I likewise give her most humble</a><br /><a>thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my</a><br /><a>forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick,</a><br /><a>all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do</a><br /><a>them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the</a><br /><a>right to trust none; and the fine is, for the which</a><br /><a>I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>DON PEDRO</b></a><blockquote><a>I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BENEDICK</b></a><blockquote><a>With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord,</a><br /><a>not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood</a><br /><a>with love than I will get again with drinking, pick</a><br /><a>out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me</a><br /><a>up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of</a><br /><a>blind Cupid.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>DON PEDRO</b></a><blockquote><a>Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou</a><br /><a>wilt prove a notable argument.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BENEDICK</b></a><blockquote><a>If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot</a><br /><a>at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on</a><br /><a>the shoulder, and called Adam.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>DON PEDRO</b></a><blockquote><a>Well, as time shall try: 'In time the savage bull</a><br /><a>doth bear the yoke.'</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BENEDICK</b></a><blockquote><a>The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible</a><br /><a>Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and set</a><br /><a>them in my forehead: and let me be vilely painted,</a><br /><a>and in such great letters as they write 'Here is</a><br /><a>good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign</a><br /><a>'Here you may see Benedick the married man.'</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CLAUDIO</b></a><blockquote><a>If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>DON PEDRO</b></a><blockquote><a>Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in</a><br /><a>Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BENEDICK</b></a><blockquote><a>I look for an earthquake too, then.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>DON PEDRO</b></a><blockquote><a>Well, you temporize with the hours. In the</a><br /><a>meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to</a><br /><a>Leonato's: commend me to him and tell him I will</a><br /><a>not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made</a><br /><a>great preparation.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BENEDICK</b></a><blockquote><a>I have almost matter enough in me for such an</a><br /><a>embassage; and so I commit you--</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CLAUDIO</b></a><blockquote><a>To the tuition of God: From my house, if I had it,--</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>DON PEDRO</b></a><blockquote><a>The sixth of July: Your loving friend, Benedick.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BENEDICK</b></a><blockquote><a>Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your</a><br /><a>discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and</a><br /><a>the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere</a><br /><a>you flout old ends any further, examine your</a><br /><a>conscience: and so I leave you.</a><br /><p><i>Exit</i></p></blockquote><a><b>CLAUDIO</b></a><blockquote><a>My liege, your highness now may do me good.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>DON PEDRO</b></a><blockquote><a>My love is thine to teach: teach it but how,</a><br /><a>And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn</a><br /><a>Any hard lesson that may do thee good.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CLAUDIO</b></a><blockquote><a>Hath Leonato any son, my lord?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>DON PEDRO</b></a><blockquote><a>No child but Hero; she's his only heir.</a><br /><a>Dost thou affect her, Claudio?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CLAUDIO</b></a><blockquote><a>O, my lord,</a><br /><a>When you went onward on this ended action,</a><br /><a>I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,</a><br /><a>That liked, but had a rougher task in hand</a><br /><a>Than to drive liking to the name of love:</a><br /><a>But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts</a><br /><a>Have left their places vacant, in their rooms</a><br /><a>Come thronging soft and delicate desires,</a><br /><a>All prompting me how fair young Hero is,</a><br /><a>Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>DON PEDRO</b></a><blockquote><a>Thou wilt be like a lover presently</a><br /><a>And tire the hearer with a book of words.</a><br /><a>If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,</a><br /><a>And I will break with her and with her father,</a><br /><a>And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end</a><br /><a>That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CLAUDIO</b></a><blockquote><a>How sweetly you do minister to love,</a><br /><a>That know love's grief by his complexion!</a><br /><a>But lest my liking might too sudden seem,</a><br /><a>I would have salved it with a longer treatise.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>DON PEDRO</b></a><blockquote><a>What need the bridge much broader than the flood?</a><br /><a>The fairest grant is the necessity.</a><br /><a>Look, what will serve is fit: 'tis once, thou lovest,</a><br /><a>And I will fit thee with the remedy.</a><br /><a>I know we shall have revelling to-night:</a><br /><a>I will assume thy part in some disguise</a><br /><a>And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,</a><br /><a>And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart</a><br /><a>And take her hearing prisoner with the force</a><br /><a>And strong encounter of my amorous tale:</a><br /><a>Then after to her father will I break;</a><br /><a>And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.</a><br /><a>In practise let us put it presently.</a><br /><p><i>Exeunt</i></p></blockquote></span><span id = 368 ><h3>SCENE II.

I cannot hide</a><br /><a>what I am: I must be sad when I have cause and smile</a><br /><a>at no man's jests, eat when I have stomach and wait</a><br /><a>for no man's leisure, sleep when I am drowsy and</a><br /><a>tend on no man's business, laugh when I am merry and</a><br /><a>claw no man in his humour.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CONRADE</b></a><blockquote><a>Yea, but you must not make the full show of this</a><br /><a>till you may do it without controlment.

I may chance have some</a><br /><a>odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,</a><br /><a>because I have railed so long against marriage: but</a><br /><a>doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat</a><br /><a>in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.</a><br /><a>Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of</a><br /><a>the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?</a><br /><a>No, the world must be peopled.
