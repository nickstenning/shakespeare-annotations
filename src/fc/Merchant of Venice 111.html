Yet his means are in supposition: he</a><br /><a>hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the</a><br /><a>Indies; I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he</a><br /><a>hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and</a><br /><a>other ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But ships</a><br /><a>are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats</a><br /><a>and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I</a><br /><a>mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters,</a><br /><a>winds and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,</a><br /><a>sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may</a><br /><a>take his bond.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BASSANIO</b></a><blockquote><a>Be assured you may.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>SHYLOCK</b></a><blockquote><a>I will be assured I may; and, that I may be assured,</a><br /><a>I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BASSANIO</b></a><blockquote><a>If it please you to dine with us.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>SHYLOCK</b></a><blockquote><a>Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which</a><br /><a>your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I</a><br /><a>will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,</a><br /><a>walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat</a><br /><a>with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What</a><br /><a>news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?</a><br /><p><i>Enter ANTONIO</i></p></blockquote><a><b>BASSANIO</b></a><blockquote><a>This is Signior Antonio.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>SHYLOCK</b></a><blockquote><a>[Aside]  How like a fawning publican he looks!</a><br /><a>I hate him for he is a Christian,</a><br /><a>But more for that in low simplicity</a><br /><a>He lends out money gratis and brings down</a><br /><a>The rate of usance here with us in Venice.</a><br /><a>If I can catch him once upon the hip,</a><br /><a>I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.</a><br /><a>He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,</a><br /><a>Even there where merchants most do congregate,</a><br /><a>On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,</a><br /><a>Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe,</a><br /><a>If I forgive him!</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BASSANIO</b></a><blockquote><a>                  Shylock, do you hear?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>SHYLOCK</b></a><blockquote><a>I am debating of my present store,</a><br /><a>And, by the near guess of my memory,</a><br /><a>I cannot instantly raise up the gross</a><br /><a>Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?</a><br /><a>Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,</a><br /><a>Will furnish me. But soft! how many months</a><br /><a>Do you desire?</a><br /><p><i>To ANTONIO</i></p><a>Rest you fair, good signior;</a><br /><a>Your worship was the last man in our mouths.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>ANTONIO</b></a><blockquote><a>Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrow</a><br /><a>By taking nor by giving of excess,</a><br /><a>Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,</a><br /><a>I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd</a><br /><a>How much ye would?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>SHYLOCK</b></a><blockquote><a>                  Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>ANTONIO</b></a><blockquote><a>And for three months.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>SHYLOCK</b></a><blockquote><a>I had forgot; three months; you told me so.</a><br /><a>Well then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you;</a><br /><a>Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow</a><br /><a>Upon advantage.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>ANTONIO</b></a><blockquote><a>                  I do never use it.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>SHYLOCK</b></a><blockquote><a>When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep--</a><br /><a>This Jacob from our holy Abram was,</a><br /><a>As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,</a><br /><a>The third possessor; ay, he was the third--</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>ANTONIO</b></a><blockquote><a>And what of him? did he take interest?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>SHYLOCK</b></a><blockquote><a>No, not take interest, not, as you would say,</a><br /><a>Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.</a><br /><a>When Laban and himself were compromised</a><br /><a>That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied</a><br /><a>Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,</a><br /><a>In the end of autumn turned to the rams,</a><br /><a>And, when the work of generation was</a><br /><a>Between these woolly breeders in the act,</a><br /><a>The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,</a><br /><a>And, in the doing of the deed of kind,</a><br /><a>He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,</a><br /><a>Who then conceiving did in eaning time</a><br /><a>Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.</a><br /><a>This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:</a><br /><a>And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>ANTONIO</b></a><blockquote><a>This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for;</a><br /><a>A thing not in his power to bring to pass,</a><br /><a>But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.</a><br /><a>Was this inserted to make interest good?</a><br /><a>Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>SHYLOCK</b></a><blockquote><a>I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:</a><br /><a>But note me, signior.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>ANTONIO</b></a><blockquote><a>Mark you this, Bassanio,</a><br /><a>The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.</a><br /><a>An evil soul producing holy witness</a><br /><a>Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,</a><br /><a>A goodly apple rotten at the heart:</a><br /><a>O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>SHYLOCK</b></a><blockquote><a>Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.</a><br /><a>Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the rate--</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>ANTONIO</b></a><blockquote><a>Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>SHYLOCK</b></a><blockquote><a>Signior Antonio, many a time and oft</a><br /><a>In the Rialto you have rated me</a><br /><a>About my moneys and my usances:</a><br /><a>Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,</a><br /><a>For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.</a><br /><a>You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,</a><br /><a>And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,</a><br /><a>And all for use of that which is mine own.</a><br /><a>Well then, it now appears you need my help:</a><br /><a>Go to, then; you come to me, and you say</a><br /><a>'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;</a><br /><a>You, that did void your rheum upon my beard</a><br /><a>And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur</a><br /><a>Over your threshold: moneys is your suit</a><br /><a>What should I say to you?
