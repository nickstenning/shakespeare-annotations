Three great ones of the city,</a><br /><a>In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,</a><br /><a>Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,</a><br /><a>I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:</a><br /><a>But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,</a><br /><a>Evades them, with a bombast circumstance</a><br /><a>Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;</a><br /><a>And, in conclusion,</a><br /><a>Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,</a><br /><a>'I have already chose my officer.'</a><br /><a>And what was he?</a><br /><a>Forsooth, a great arithmetician,</a><br /><a>One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,</a><br /><a>A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;</a><br /><a>That never set a squadron in the field,</a><br /><a>Nor the division of a battle knows</a><br /><a>More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,</a><br /><a>Wherein the toged consuls can propose</a><br /><a>As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,</a><br /><a>Is all his soldiership.

But, I beseech you,</a><br /><a>If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,</a><br /><a>As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,</a><br /><a>At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,</a><br /><a>Transported, with no worse nor better guard</a><br /><a>But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,</a><br /><a>To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--</a><br /><a>If this be known to you and your allowance,</a><br /><a>We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;</a><br /><a>But if you know not this, my manners tell me</a><br /><a>We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe</a><br /><a>That, from the sense of all civility,</a><br /><a>I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:</a><br /><a>Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,</a><br /><a>I say again, hath made a gross revolt;</a><br /><a>Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes</a><br /><a>In an extravagant and wheeling stranger</a><br /><a>Of here and every where.

O, would you had had her!</a><br /><a>Some one way, some another. Do you know</a><br /><a>Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>RODERIGO</b></a><blockquote><a>I think I can discover him, if you please,</a><br /><a>To get good guard and go along with me.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BRABANTIO</b></a><blockquote><a>Pray you, lead on.
