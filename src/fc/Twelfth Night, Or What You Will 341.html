These clothes<br />are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too; and they<br />be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps.<br /><br />MARIA.<br />That quaffing and drinking will undo you.

Who are they?<br /><br />MARIA.<br />They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.<br /><br />SIR TOBY.<br />With drinking healths to my niece. I'll drink to her as long as<br />there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria: he's a<br />coward and a coystrill that will not drink to my niece<br />till his brains turn o' th' toe like a parish-top.

Your niece will not be<br />seen; or, if she be, it's four to one she'll none of me: the<br />count himself here hard by wooes her.<br /><br />SIR TOBY.<br />She'll none o' th' count. She'll not match above her degree,<br />neither in estate, years, nor wit; I have heard her swear't. Tut,<br />there's life in't, man.<br /><br />SIR ANDREW.<br />I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' th' strangest mind i'<br />th' world; I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether.<br /><br />SIR TOBY.<br />Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?<br /><br />SIR ANDREW.<br />As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the degree of my<br />betters; and yet I will not compare with an old man.<br /><br />SIR TOBY.<br />What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?<br /><br />SIR ANDREW.<br />Faith, I can cut a caper.<br /><br />SIR TOBY.<br />And I can cut the mutton to't.<br /><br />SIR ANDREW.<br />And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in<br />Illyria.<br /><br />SIR TOBY.<br />Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have these gifts a<br />curtain before 'em? are they like to take dust, like Mistress<br />Mall's picture? why dost thou not go to church in a galliard, and<br />come home in a coranto?

Any thing<br />that's mended is but patch'd; virtue that transgresses is but<br />patch'd with sin; and sin that amends is but patch'd with virtue.<br />If that this simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not,<br />what remedy?

But I<br />perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not<br />extort from me what I am willing to<br />keep in; therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express<br />myself. You must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,<br />which I called Roderigo. My father was that Sebastian of<br />Messaline whom I know you have heard of. He left behind him<br />myself and a sister, both born in an hour.

To be up after<br />midnight, and to go to bed then, is early; so that to go to bed<br />after midnight is to go to bed betimes. Does not our life<br />consist of the four elements?<br /><br />SIR ANDREW.<br />Faith, so they say; but I think it rather consists of eating and<br />drinking.<br /><br />SIR TOBY.<br />Thou 'rt a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink.

In sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling<br />last night, when thou spokest of Pigrogromitus, of the Vapians<br />passing the equinoctial of Queubus; 't was very good, i' faith. I<br />sent thee sixpence for thy leman; hadst it?<br /><br />CLOWN.<br />I did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio's nose is no<br />whipstock; my lady has a white hand, and the Myrmidons are no<br />bottle-ale houses.<br /><br />SIR ANDREW.<br />Excellent! why, this is the best fooling, when all is done. Now,<br />a song.<br /><br />SIR TOBY.<br />Come on; there is sixpence for you: let's have a song.<br /><br />SIR ANDREW.<br />There's a testril of me too.

My lady bade me tell you<br />that, though she harbours you as her kins-man, she's nothing<br />allied to your disorders.

I could be sad; this does make some obstruction in the<br />blood, this cross-gartering; but what of that? if it please the<br />eye of one, it is with me as the very true<br />sonnet is, 'Please one, and please all.'<br /><br />OLIVIA.<br />Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?<br /><br />MALVOLIO.<br />Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs.

This concurs directly with the letter: she sends him<br />on purpose, that I may appear stubborn to him; for she incites me<br />to that in the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she; 'be<br />opposite with kinsman, surly with servants; let thy tongue tang<br />with arguments of state; put thyself into the trick of<br />singularity'; and, consequently, sets down the manner how; as, a<br />sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit of<br />some sir of note, and so forth. I have lim'd her; but it is<br />Jove's doing, and Jove make me thankful! And when she went away<br />now, 'Let this fellow be look'd to'; fellow! not Malvolio, nor<br />after my degree, but fellow. Why, every thing adheres together,<br />that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle,<br />no incredulous or unsafe circumstance,-- what can be said?<br />Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of<br />my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and he is to be<br />thank'd.<br /><br />[Re-enter MARIA, with SIR TOBY and FABIAN.]<br /><br />SIR TOBY.<br />Which way is he, in the name of sanctity?

How do you, Malvolio? how is 't with you? What, man! defy<br />the devil; consider, he 's an enemy to mankind.<br /><br />MALVOLIO.<br />Do you know what you say?<br /><br />MARIA.<br />La you, and you speak ill of the devil, how he takes it at heart!<br />Pray God, he be not bewitch'd!

So soon as ever thou see'st him, draw; and as<br />thou drawest, swear horrible; for it comes to pass oft, that a<br />terrible oath, with a swaggering accent sharply twang'd off,<br />gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have<br />earn'd him. Away!<br /><br />SIR ANDREW.<br />Nay, let me alone for swearing.<br />[Exit.]<br /><br />SIR TOBY.<br />Now will not I deliver his letter; for the behaviour of the young<br />gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding; his<br />employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less:<br />therefore this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed<br />no terror in the youth; he will find it comes from a clodpole.<br />But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth; set upon<br />Aguecheek a notable report of valour; and drive the gentleman, as<br />I know his youth will aptly receive it, into a most hideous<br />opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity. This will so<br />fright them both, that they will kill one another by the look,<br />like cockatrices.<br /><br />[Re-enter OLIVIA with VIOLA.]<br /><br />FABIAN.<br />Here he comes with your niece; give them way till he take leave,<br />and presently after him.<br /><br />SIR TOBY.<br />I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a<br />challenge.<br /><br />[Exeunt SIR TOBY, FABIAN, and MARIA.]<br /><br />OLIVIA.<br />I have said too much unto a heart of stone,<br />And laid mine honour too unchary out.<br />There 's something in me that reproves my fault;<br />But such a headstrong potent fault it is,<br />That it but mocks reproof.<br /><br />VIOLA.<br />With the same haviour that your passion bears,<br />Goes on my master's grief.<br /><br />OLIVIA.<br />Here, wear this jewel for me, 't is my picture:<br />Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you:<br />And I beseech you come again to-morrow.<br />What shall you ask of me that I 'll deny,<br />That honour sav'd may upon asking give?<br /><br />VIOLA.<br />Nothing but this,-- your true love for my master.<br /><br />OLIVIA.<br />How with mine honour may I give him that<br />Which I have given to you?<br /><br />VIOLA.<br />I will acquit you.<br /><br />OLIVIA.<br />Well, come again to-morrow; fare thee well.<br />A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.<br />[Exit.]<br /><br />[Re-enter SIR TOBY and FABIAN.]<br /><br />SIR TOBY.<br />Gentleman, God save thee!<br /><br />VIOLA.<br />And you, sir.<br /><br />SIR TOBY.<br />That defence thou hast, betake thee to 't. Of what nature the<br />wrongs are thou hast done him, I know not; but thy intercepter,<br />full of despite, bloody as the hunter, attends thee at the<br />orchard-end. Dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation; for<br />thy assailant is quick, skilful, and deadly.<br /><br />VIOLA.<br />You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me: my<br />remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence done<br />to any man.<br /><br />SIR TOBY.<br />You'll find it otherwise, I assure you. Therefore, if you hold<br />your life at any price, betake you to your guard; for your<br />opposite hath in him what youth, strength, skill, and wrath can<br />furnish man withal.<br /><br />VIOLA.<br />I pray you, sir, what is he?<br /><br />SIR TOBY.<br />He is knight, dubb'd with unhatch'd rapier and on carpet<br />consideration; but he is a devil in private brawl: souls and<br />bodies hath he divorc'd three; and his incensement at this moment<br />is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of<br />death and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word; give 't or take 't.<br /><br />VIOLA.<br />I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the<br />lady. I am no fighter. I have heard of some kind of men that put<br />quarrels purposely on others, to taste their valour; belike this<br />is a man of that quirk.<br /><br />SIR TOBY.<br />Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a very competent<br />injury. Therefore get you on and give him his desire. Back you<br />shall not to the house, unless you undertake that with<br />me which with as much safety you might answer him. Therefore on,<br />or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you must, that 's<br />certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.<br /><br />VIOLA.<br />This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me this<br />courteous office, as to know of the knight what my offence to him<br />is; it is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.<br /><br />SIR TOBY.<br />I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman till my<br />return.<br />[Exit.]<br /><br />VIOLA.<br />Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?<br /><br />FABIAN.<br />I know the knight is incens'd against you, even to a mortal<br />arbitrement; but nothing of the circumstance more.<br /><br />VIOLA.<br />I beseech you, what manner of man is he?<br /><br />FABIAN.<br />Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by his form, as<br />you are like to find him in the proof of his valour. He is,<br />indeed, sir, the most skilful, bloody, and fatal opposite that<br />you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria. Will you<br />walk towards him? I will make your peace with him, if I can.<br /><br />VIOLA.<br />I shall be much bound to you for 't. I am one that had rather go<br />with sir priest than sir knight; I care not who knows so much of<br />my mettle.<br /><br />[Exeunt.]<br /><br />[Re-enter SIR TOBY, with SIR ANDREW.]<br /><br />SIR TOBY.<br />Why, man, he's a very devil; I have not seen such a firago.

They say he has been fencer to<br />the Sophy.<br /><br />SIR ANDREW.<br />Pox on 't, I'll not meddle with him.<br /><br />SIR TOBY.<br />Ay, but he will not now be pacified; Fabian can scarce hold him<br />yonder.<br /><br />SIR ANDREW.<br />Plague on 't; and I thought he had been valiant and so cunning in<br />fence, I'd have seen him damn'd ere I 'd have challeng'd him. Let<br />him let the matter slip, and I 'll give him my horse, gray<br />Capilet.<br /><br />SIR TOBY.<br />I 'll make the motion. Stand here, make a good show on 't; this<br />shall end without the perdition of souls. [Aside] Marry, I 'll<br />ride your horse as well as I ride you.<br /><br />[Re-enter FABIAN and VIOLA.]<br /><br />[To FABIAN] I have his horse to take up the quarrel; I have<br />persuaded him the youth 's a devil.<br /><br />FABIAN.<br />He is as horribly conceited of him; and pants and looks pale, as<br />if a bear were at his heels.<br /><br />SIR TOBY.<br />[To VIOLA] There 's no remedy, sir: he will fight with you for 's<br />oath sake. Marry, he hath better bethought him of his quarrel,<br />and he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of: therefore<br />draw, for the supportance of his vow; he protests he will not<br />hurt you.<br /><br />VIOLA.<br />[Aside] Pray God defend me! A little thing would make me tell<br />them how much I lack of a man.<br /><br />FABIAN.<br />Give ground, if you see him furious.<br /><br />SIR TOBY.<br />Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy; the gentleman will, for his<br />honour's sake, have one bout with you; he cannot by the duello<br />avoid it; but he has promis'd me, as he is a gentleman and a<br />soldier, he will not hurt you. Come on; to 't.<br /><br />SIR ANDREW.<br />Pray God, he keep his oath!<br /><br />VIOLA.<br />I do assure you 't is against my will.

My having is not much;<br />I 'll make division of my present with you:<br />Hold, there 's half my coffer.<br /><br />ANTONIO.<br />Will you deny me now?<br />Is 't possible that my deserts to you<br />Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,<br />Lest that it make me so unsound a man<br />As to upbraid you with those kindnesses<br />That I have done for you.<br /><br />VIOLA.<br />I know of none;<br />Nor know I you by voice or any feature.<br />I hate ingratitude more in a man<br />Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,<br />Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption<br />Inhabits our frail blood.<br /><br />ANTONIO.<br />O heavens themselves!<br /><br />2 OFFICER.<br />Come, sir, I pray you, go.<br /><br />ANTONIO.<br />Let me speak a little.
