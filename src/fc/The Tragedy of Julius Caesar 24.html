I saw Mark</a><br /><a>Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown</a><br /><a>neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told</a><br /><a>you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my</a><br /><a>thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he</a><br /><a>offered it to him again; then he put it by again:</a><br /><a>but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his</a><br /><a>fingers off it. And then he offered it the third</a><br /><a>time; he put it the third time by: and still as he</a><br /><a>refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their</a><br /><a>chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps</a><br /><a>and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because</a><br /><a>Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked</a><br /><a>Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and</a><br /><a>for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of</a><br /><a>opening my lips and receiving the bad air.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CASSIUS</b></a><blockquote><a>But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CASCA</b></a><blockquote><a>He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at</a><br /><a>mouth, and was speechless.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BRUTUS</b></a><blockquote><a>'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CASSIUS</b></a><blockquote><a>No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,</a><br /><a>And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CASCA</b></a><blockquote><a>I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,</a><br /><a>Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not</a><br /><a>clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and</a><br /><a>displeased them, as they use to do the players in</a><br /><a>the theatre, I am no true man.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BRUTUS</b></a><blockquote><a>What said he when he came unto himself?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CASCA</b></a><blockquote><a>Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the</a><br /><a>common herd was glad he refused the crown, he</a><br /><a>plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his</a><br /><a>throat to cut. An I had been a man of any</a><br /><a>occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,</a><br /><a>I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so</a><br /><a>he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,</a><br /><a>If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired</a><br /><a>their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three</a><br /><a>or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good</a><br /><a>soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but</a><br /><a>there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had</a><br /><a>stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BRUTUS</b></a><blockquote><a>And after that, he came, thus sad, away?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CASCA</b></a><blockquote><a>Ay.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CASSIUS</b></a><blockquote><a>Did Cicero say any thing?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CASCA</b></a><blockquote><a>Ay, he spoke Greek.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CASSIUS</b></a><blockquote><a>To what effect?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CASCA</b></a><blockquote><a>Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the</a><br /><a>face again: but those that understood him smiled at</a><br /><a>one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own</a><br /><a>part, it was Greek to me.
