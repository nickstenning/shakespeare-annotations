Rome. A street.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter a company of mutinous Citizens, with staves, clubs, and other weapons <br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.<br /><br />All<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak, speak.<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?<br /><br />All<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resolved. resolved.<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.<br /><br />All<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know't, we know't.<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is't a verdict?<br /><br />All<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!<br /><br />Second Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One word, good citizens.<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would yield us but the superfluity, while it were<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but they think we are too dear: the leanness that<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inventory to particularise their abundance; our<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.<br /><br />Second Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?<br /><br />All<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.<br /><br />Second Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider you what services he has done for his country?<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very well; and could be content to give him good<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.<br /><br />Second Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay, but speak not maliciously.<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; content to say it was for his country he did it to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; please his mother and to be partly proud; which he<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is, even till the altitude of his virtue.<br /><br />Second Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What he cannot help in his nature, you account a<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shouts within<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What shouts are these? The other side o' the city<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!<br /><br />All<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, come.<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soft! who comes here?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA<br /><br />Second Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the people.<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have strong arms too.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you undo yourselves?<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We cannot, sir, we are undone already.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tell you, friends, most charitable care<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have the patricians of you. For your wants,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against the Roman state, whose course will on<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of more strong link asunder than can ever<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gods, not the patricians, make it, and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are transported by calamity<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thither where more attends you, and you slander<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you curse them as enemies.<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; established against the rich, and provide more<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there's all the love they bear us.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Either you must<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To stale 't a little more.<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you, deliver.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a time when all the body's members<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That only like a gulf it did remain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, mutually participate, did minister<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unto the appetite and affection common<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, sir, what answer made the belly?<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For, look you, I may make the belly smile<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As well as speak--it tauntingly replied<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the discontented members, the mutinous parts<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That envied his receipt; even so most fitly<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you malign our senators for that<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are not such as you.<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your belly's answer? What!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With other muniments and petty helps<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this our fabric, if that they--<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What then?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is the sink o' the body,--<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, what then?<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The former agents, if they did complain,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What could the belly answer?<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will tell you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye're long about it.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note me this, good friend;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your most grave belly was deliberate,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That I receive the general food at first,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which you do live upon; and fit it is,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because I am the store-house and the shop<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I send it through the rivers of your blood,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, through the cranks and offices of man,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The strongest nerves and small inferior veins<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From me receive that natural competency<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereby they live: and though that all at once,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ay, sir; well, well.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Though all at once cannot<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See what I do deliver out to each,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet I can make my audit up, that all<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From me do back receive the flour of all,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was an answer: how apply you this?<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The senators of Rome are this good belly,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you the mutinous members; for examine<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No public benefit which you receive<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it proceeds or comes from them to you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And no way from yourselves. What do you think,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You, the great toe of this assembly?<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I the great toe! why the great toe?<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lead'st first to win some vantage.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The one side must have bale.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter CAIUS MARCIUS<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hail, noble Marcius!<br /><br />MARCIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make yourselves scabs?<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have ever your good word.<br /><br />MARCIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He that will give good words to thee will flatter<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make him worthy whose offence subdues him<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And curse that justice did it.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who deserves greatness<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deserves your hate; and your affections are<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sick man's appetite, who desires most that<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which would increase his evil. He that depends<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon your favours swims with fins of lead<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With every minute you do change a mind,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And call him noble that was now your hate,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That in these several places of the city<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You cry against the noble senate, who,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The city is well stored.<br /><br />MARCIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hang 'em! They say!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who thrives and who declines; side factions<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and give out<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conjectural marriages; making parties strong<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And feebling such as stand not in their liking<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grain enough!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I could pick my lance.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For though abundantly they lack discretion,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What says the other troop?<br /><br />MARCIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are dissolved: hang 'em!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a petition granted them, a strange one--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To break the heart of generosity,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shouting their emulation.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is granted them?<br /><br />MARCIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Win upon power and throw forth greater themes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For insurrection's arguing.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is strange.<br /><br />MARCIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go, get you home, you fragments!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter a Messenger, hastily<br /><br />Messenger<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where's Caius Marcius?<br /><br />MARCIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here: what's the matter?<br /><br />Messenger<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.<br /><br />MARCIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our musty superfluity.

When yet he was but<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how honour would become such a person. that it was<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than now in first seeing he had proved himself a<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; man.<br /><br />VIRGILIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But had he died in the business, madam; how then?<br /><br />VOLUMNIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then his good report should have been my son; I<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; therein would have found issue.

O' my troth, I looked upon him o'<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wednesday half an hour together: has such a<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; again; and after it again; and over and over he<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; comes, and again; catched it again; or whether his<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; teeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it!<br /><br />VOLUMNIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One on 's father's moods.<br /><br />VALERIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.<br /><br />VIRGILIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A crack, madam.<br /><br />VALERIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the idle husewife with me this afternoon.<br /><br />VIRGILIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, good madam; I will not out of doors.<br /><br />VALERIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not out of doors!<br /><br />VOLUMNIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She shall, she shall.<br /><br />VIRGILIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; threshold till my lord return from the wars.<br /><br />VALERIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you must go visit the good lady that lies in.<br /><br />VIRGILIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my prayers; but I cannot go thither.<br /><br />VOLUMNIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, I pray you?<br /><br />VIRGILIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.<br /><br />VALERIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ithaca full of moths.

If any such be here--<br />As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting<br />Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear<br />Lesser his person than an ill report;<br />If any think brave death outweighs bad life<br />And that his country's dearer than himself;<br />Let him alone, or so many so minded,<br />Wave thus, to express his disposition,<br />And follow Marcius.<br />They all shout and wave their swords, take him up in their arms, and cast up their caps<br />O, me alone! make you a sword of me?<br />If these shows be not outward, which of you<br />But is four Volsces? none of you but is<br />Able to bear against the great Aufidius<br />A shield as hard as his. A certain number,<br />Though thanks to all, must I select<br />from all: the rest<br />Shall bear the business in some other fight,<br />As cause will be obey'd.

Rome. A public place.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter MENENIUS with the two Tribunes of the people, SICINIUS and BRUTUS. <br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good or bad?<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not according to the prayer of the people, for they<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; love not Marcius.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pray you, who does the wolf love?<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lamb.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; noble Marcius.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.<br /><br />Both<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, sir.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have not in abundance?<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially in pride.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And topping all others in boasting.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is strange now: do you two know how you are<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right-hand file? do you?<br /><br />Both<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, how are we censured?<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?<br /><br />Both<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, well, sir, well.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; being proud?<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do it not alone, sir.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know you can do very little alone; for your helps<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; single: your abilities are too infant-like for<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and make but an interior survey of your good selves!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O that you could!<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What then, sir?<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any in Rome.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Menenius, you are known well enough too.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upon too trivial motion; one that converses more<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the buttock of the night than with the forehead<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compound with the major part of your syllables: and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; though I must be content to bear with those that say<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tell you you have good faces. If you see this in<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well enough too? what barm can your bisson<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; known well enough too?<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; second day of audience. When you are hearing a<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; matter between party and party, if you chance to be<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pinched with the colic, you make faces like<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mummers; set up the bloody flag against all<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by your hearing: all the peace you make in their<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a pair of strange ones.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, come, you are well understood to be a<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perfecter giber for the table than a necessary<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bencher in the Capitol.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your worships: more of your conversation would<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BRUTUS and SICINIUS go aside<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and VALERIA<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your eyes so fast?<br /><br />VOLUMNIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the love of Juno, let's go.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ha! Marcius coming home!<br /><br />VOLUMNIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; approbation.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marcius coming home!<br /><br />VOLUMNIA VIRGILIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay,'tis true.<br /><br />VOLUMNIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; another, his wife another; and, I think, there's one<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at home for you.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me!<br /><br />VIRGILIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; years' health; in which time I will make a lip at<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the physician: the most sovereign prescription in<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.<br /><br />VIRGILIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O, no, no, no.<br /><br />VOLUMNIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.<br /><br />VOLUMNIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the oaken garland.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?<br /><br />VOLUMNIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aufidius got off.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?<br /><br />VOLUMNIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has letters from the general, wherein he gives my<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; son the whole name of the war: he hath in this<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; action outdone his former deeds doubly<br /><br />VALERIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; true purchasing.<br /><br />VIRGILIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gods grant them true!<br /><br />VOLUMNIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True! pow, wow.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True! I'll be sworn they are true.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is he wounded?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the Tribunes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God save your good worships! Marcius is coming<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?<br /><br />VOLUMNIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stand for his place. He received in the repulse of<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tarquin seven hurts i' the body.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nine that I know.<br /><br />VOLUMNIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wounds upon him.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A shout and flourish<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hark! the trumpets.<br /><br />VOLUMNIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the general, and TITUS LARTIUS; between them, CORIOLANUS, crowned with an oaken garland; with Captains and Soldiers, and a Herald<br /><br />Herald<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within Corioli gates: where he hath won,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In honour follows Coriolanus.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flourish<br /><br />All<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No more of this; it does offend my heart:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pray now, no more.<br /><br />COMINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, sir, your mother!<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have, I know, petition'd all the gods<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For my prosperity!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kneels<br /><br />VOLUMNIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay, my good soldier, up;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By deed-achieving honour newly named,--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But O, thy wife!<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My gracious silence, hail!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And mothers that lack sons.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the gods crown thee!<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And live you yet?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To VALERIA<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O my sweet lady, pardon.<br /><br />VOLUMNIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know not where to turn: O, welcome home:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A curse begin at very root on's heart,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is not glad to see thee! You are three<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have some old crab-trees here<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at home that will not<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We call a nettle but a nettle and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The faults of fools but folly.<br /><br />COMINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever right.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Menenius ever, ever.<br /><br />Herald<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give way there, and go on!<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [To VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA] Your hand, and yours:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere in our own house I do shade my head,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The good patricians must be visited;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From whom I have received not only greetings,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But with them change of honours.<br /><br />VOLUMNIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have lived<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To see inherited my very wishes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the buildings of my fancy: only<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Rome will cast upon thee.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Know, good mother,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had rather be their servant in my way,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than sway with them in theirs.<br /><br />COMINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On, to the Capitol!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flourish. Cornets. Exeunt in state, as before. BRUTUS and SICINIUS come forward<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Into a rapture lets her baby cry<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With variable complexions, all agreeing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do press among the popular throngs and puff<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commit the war of white and damask in<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As if that whatsoever god who leads him<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were slily crept into his human powers<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And gave him graceful posture.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the sudden,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I warrant him consul.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then our office may,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During his power, go sleep.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He cannot temperately transport his honours<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From where he should begin and end, but will<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lose those he hath won.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that there's comfort.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doubt not<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The commoners, for whom we stand, but they<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon their ancient malice will forget<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the least cause these his new honours, which<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That he will give them make I as little question<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he is proud to do't.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard him swear,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were he to stand for consul, never would he<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appear i' the market-place nor on him put<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The napless vesture of humility;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the people, beg their stinking breaths.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tis right.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was his word: O, he would miss it rather<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the desire of the nobles.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish no better<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than have him hold that purpose and to put it<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In execution.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tis most like he will.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It shall be to him then as our good wills,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sure destruction.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it must fall out<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To him or our authorities. For an end,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must suggest the people in what hatred<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He still hath held them; that to's power he would<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In human action and capacity,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of no more soul nor fitness for the world<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than camels in the war, who have their provand<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For sinking under them.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, as you say, suggested<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At some time when his soaring insolence<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall darken him for ever.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter a Messenger<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the matter?<br /><br />Messenger<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That Marcius shall be consul:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to Jove's statue, and the commons made<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never saw the like.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's to the Capitol;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But hearts for the event.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have with you.</span><span id = 18343 >SCENE II. The same. The Capitol.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter two Officers, to lay cushions <br /><br />First Officer<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for consulships?<br /><br />Second Officer<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coriolanus will carry it.<br /><br />First Officer<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loves not the common people.<br /><br />Second Officer<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faith, there had been many great men that have<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be many that they have loved, they know not<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him manifests the true knowledge he has in their<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them plainly see't.<br /><br />First Officer<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If he did not care whether he had their love or no,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; devotion than can render it him; and leaves<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing undone that may fully discover him their<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dislikes, to flatter them for their love.<br /><br />Second Officer<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; having been supple and courteous to the people,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bonneted, without any further deed to have them at<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an into their estimation and report: but he hath so<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in their hearts, that for their tongues to be<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.<br /><br />First Officer<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are coming.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sennet. Enter, with actors before them, COMINIUS the consul, MENENIUS, CORIOLANUS, Senators, SICINIUS and BRUTUS. The Senators take their places; the Tribunes take their Places by themselves. CORIOLANUS stands<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having determined of the Volsces and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the main point of this our after-meeting,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To gratify his noble service that<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath thus stood for his country: therefore,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; please you,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most reverend and grave elders, to desire<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The present consul, and last general<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our well-found successes, to report<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little of that worthy work perform'd<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We met here both to thank and to remember<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With honours like himself.<br /><br />First Senator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak, good Cominius:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leave nothing out for length, and make us think<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather our state's defective for requital<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than we to stretch it out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the Tribunes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Masters o' the people,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do request your kindest ears, and after,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your loving motion toward the common body,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To yield what passes here.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are convented<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inclinable to honour and advance<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The theme of our assembly.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which the rather<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall be blest to do, if he remember<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A kinder value of the people than<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hath hereto prized them at.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's off, that's off;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would you rather had been silent. Please you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To hear Cominius speak?<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most willingly;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But yet my caution was more pertinent<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than the rebuke you give it.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He loves your people<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But tie him not to be their bedfellow.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worthy Cominius, speak.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CORIOLANUS offers to go away<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay, keep your place.<br /><br />First Senator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What you have nobly done.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your horror's pardon:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had rather have my wounds to heal again<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than hear say how I got them.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I hope<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My words disbench'd you not.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, sir: yet oft,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your people,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love them as they weigh.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pray now, sit down.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the alarum were struck than idly sit<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To hear my nothings monster'd.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Masters of the people,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's thousand to one good one--when you now see<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had rather venture all his limbs for honour<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.<br /><br />COMINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That valour is the chiefest virtue, and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most dignifies the haver: if it be,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man I speak of cannot in the world<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When with his Amazonian chin he drove<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bristled lips before him: be bestrid<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he might act the woman in the scene,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in the brunt of seventeen battles since<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before and in Corioli, let me say,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And by his rare example made the coward<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn terror into sport: as weeds before<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A vessel under sail, so men obey'd<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was a thing of blood, whose every motion<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mortal gate of the city, which he painted<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With shunless destiny; aidless came off,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with a sudden reinforcement struck<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corioli like a planet: now all's his:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to the battle came he; where he did<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both field and city ours, he never stood<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ease his breast with panting.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worthy man!<br /><br />First Senator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He cannot but with measure fit the honours<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which we devise him.<br /><br />COMINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our spoils he kick'd at,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And look'd upon things precious as they were<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The common muck of the world: he covets less<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than misery itself would give; rewards<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His deeds with doing them, and is content<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To spend the time to end it.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's right noble:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let him be call'd for.<br /><br />First Senator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call Coriolanus.<br /><br />Officer<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He doth appear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Re-enter CORIOLANUS<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make thee consul.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do owe them still<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My life and services.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It then remains<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That you do speak to the people.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do beseech you,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That I may pass this doing.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the people<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must have their voices; neither will they bate<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One jot of ceremony.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put them not to't:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pray you, go fit you to the custom and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take to you, as your predecessors have,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your honour with your form.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is apart<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That I shall blush in acting, and might well<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be taken from the people.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark you that?<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As if I had received them for the hire<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of their breath only!<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not stand upon't.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wish we all joy and honour.<br /><br />Senators<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flourish of cornets. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You see how he intends to use the people.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May they perceive's intent! He will require them,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As if he did contemn what he requested<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should be in them to give.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, we'll inform them<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know, they do attend us.</span><span id = 18344 >SCENE III. The same. The Forum.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter seven or eight Citizens <br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.<br /><br />Second Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may, sir, if we will.<br /><br />Third Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; power that we have no power to do; for if he show us<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were to make a monster of the multitude: of the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which we being members, should bring ourselves to be<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; monstrous members.<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to make us no better thought of, a little help<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.<br /><br />Third Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been called so of many; not that our heads<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and their consent of one direct way should be at<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; once to all the points o' the compass.<br /><br />Second Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fly?<br /><br />Third Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.<br /><br />Second Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why that way?<br /><br />Third Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.<br /><br />Second Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are never without your tricks: you may, you may.<br /><br />Third Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you all resolved to give your voices? But<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say, if he would incline to the people, there was<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; never a worthier man.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter CORIOLANUS in a gown of humility, with MENENIUS<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by threes. He's to make his requests by<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; particulars; wherein every one of us has a single<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; honour, in giving him our own voices with our own<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you how<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you shall go by him.<br /><br />All<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Content, content.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exeunt Citizens<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O sir, you are not right: have you not known<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The worthiest men have done't?<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What must I say?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got them in my country's service, when<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the noise of our own drums.'<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O me, the gods!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must not speak of that: you must desire them<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To think upon you.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think upon me! hang 'em!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would they would forget me, like the virtues<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which our divines lose by 'em.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'll mar all:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In wholesome manner.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bid them wash their faces<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And keep their teeth clean.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Re-enter two of the Citizens<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, here comes a brace.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Re-enter a third Citizen<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know the cause, air, of my standing here.<br /><br />Third Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mine own desert.<br /><br />Second Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your own desert!<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ay, but not mine own desire.<br /><br />Third Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How not your own desire?<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; poor with begging.<br /><br />Third Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gain by you.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The price is to ask it kindly.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; show you, which shall be yours in private. Your<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good voice, sir; what say you?<br /><br />Second Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You shall ha' it, worthy sir.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; begged. I have your alms: adieu.<br /><br />Third Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is something odd.<br /><br />Second Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exeunt the three Citizens<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Re-enter two other Citizens<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; voices that I may be consul, I have here the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customary gown.<br /><br />Fourth Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have deserved nobly of your country, and you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have not deserved nobly.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your enigma?<br /><br />Fourth Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the common people.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should account me the more virtuous that I have<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the insinuating nod and be off to them most<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bewitchment of some popular man and give it<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I may be consul.<br /><br />Fifth Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you our voices heartily.<br /><br />Fourth Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have received many wounds for your country.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.<br /><br />Both Citizens<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exeunt<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most sweet voices!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Better it is to die, better to starve,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What custom wills, in all things should we do't,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dust on antique time would lie unswept,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And mountainous error be too highly heapt<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let the high office and the honour go<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To one that would do thus. I am half through;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Re-enter three Citizens more<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here come more voices.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your voices: for your voices I have fought;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen and heard of; for your voices have<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Done many things, some less, some more your voices:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed I would be consul.<br /><br />Sixth Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; man's voice.<br /><br />Seventh Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and make him good friend to the people!<br /><br />All Citizens<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exeunt<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worthy voices!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Re-enter MENENIUS, with BRUTUS and SICINIUS<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Endue you with the people's voice: remains<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That, in the official marks invested, you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anon do meet the senate.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this done?<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The custom of request you have discharged:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people do admit you, and are summon'd<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To meet anon, upon your approbation.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where? at the senate-house?<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There, Coriolanus.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I change these garments?<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may, sir.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Repair to the senate-house.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll keep you company. Will you along?<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We stay here for the people.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fare you well.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has it now, and by his looks methink<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tis warm at 's heart.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will you dismiss the people?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Re-enter Citizens<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How now, my masters! have you chose this man?<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has our voices, sir.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.<br /><br />Second Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.<br /><br />Third Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He flouted us downright.<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.<br /><br />Second Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, so he did, I am sure.<br /><br />Citizens<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, no; no man saw 'em.<br /><br />Third Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said he had wounds, which he could show<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in private;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But by your voices, will not so permit me;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your most sweet voices: now you have left<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your voices,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why either were you ignorant to see't,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To yield your voices?<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you not have told him<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But was a petty servant to the state,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was your enemy, ever spake against<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your liberties and the charters that you bear<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A place of potency and sway o' the state,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If he should still malignantly remain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be curses to yourselves? You should have said<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That as his worthy deeds did claim no less<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would think upon you for your voices and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Translate his malice towards you into love,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing your friendly lord.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus to have said,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Either his gracious promise, which you might,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As cause had call'd you up, have held him to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which easily endures not article<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And pass'd him unelected.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you perceive<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He did solicit you in free contempt<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he did need your loves, and do you think<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against the rectorship of judgment?<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere now denied the asker? and now again<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your sued-for tongues?<br /><br />Third Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.<br /><br />Second Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And will deny him:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have chose a consul that will from them take<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their liberties; make them of no more voice<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than dogs that are as often beat for barking<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As therefore kept to do so.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let them assemble,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on a safer judgment all revoke<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With what contempt he wore the humble weed,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinking upon his services, took from you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The apprehension of his present portance,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the inveterate hate he bears you.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lay<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No impediment between, but that you must<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cast your election on him.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say, you chose him<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More after our commandment than as guided<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By your own true affections, and that your minds,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preoccupied with what you rather must do<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than what you should, made you against the grain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How youngly he began to serve his country,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How long continued, and what stock he springs of,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That our beat water brought by conduits hither;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And [Censorinus,] nobly named so,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twice being [by the people chosen] censor,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was his great ancestor.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thus descended,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That hath beside well in his person wrought<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be set high in place, we did commend<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To your remembrances: but you have found,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scaling his present bearing with his past,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your sudden approbation.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say, you ne'er had done't--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harp on that still--but by our putting on;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And presently, when you have drawn your number,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Repair to the Capitol.<br /><br />All<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will so: almost all<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Repent in their election.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exeunt Citizens<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let them go on;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This mutiny were better put in hazard,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than stay, past doubt, for greater:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If, as his nature is, he fall in rage<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With their refusal, both observe and answer<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vantage of his anger.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the Capitol, come:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will be there before the stream o' the people;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which we have goaded onward.</span><span id = 18345 >SCENE I. Rome. A street.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cornets. Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, all the Gentry, COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators <br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?<br /><br />LARTIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had, my lord; and that it was which caused<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our swifter composition.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So then the Volsces stand but as at first,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon's again.<br /><br />COMINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are worn, lord consul, so,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That we shall hardly in our ages see<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their banners wave again.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saw you Aufidius?<br /><br />LARTIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spoke he of me?<br /><br />LARTIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He did, my lord.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How? what?<br /><br />LARTIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How often he had met you, sword to sword;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That of all things upon the earth he hated<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To hopeless restitution, so he might<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be call'd your vanquisher.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Antium lives he?<br /><br />LARTIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Antium.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I had a cause to seek him there,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For they do prank them in authority,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against all noble sufferance.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass no further.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ha! what is that?<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be dangerous to go on: no further.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What makes this change?<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The matter?<br /><br />COMINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cominius, no.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have I had children's voices?<br /><br />First Senator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people are incensed against him.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stop,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or all will fall in broil.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are these your herd?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must these have voices, that can yield them now<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And straight disclaim their tongues?

By yond clouds,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your fellow tribune.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You show too much of that<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For which the people stir: if you will pass<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or never be so noble as a consul,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor yoke with him for tribune.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's be calm.<br /><br />COMINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people are abused; set on.

My nobler friends,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I crave their pardons:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regard me as I do not flatter, and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therein behold themselves: I say again,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and scatter'd,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which they have given to beggars.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, no more.<br /><br />First Senator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No more words, we beseech you.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How! no more!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for my country I have shed my blood,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coin words till their decay against those measles,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The very way to catch them.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You speak o' the people,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As if you were a god to punish, not<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man of their infirmity.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Twere well<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We let the people know't.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What, what? his choler?<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choler!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Jove, 'twould be my mind!<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a mind<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That shall remain a poison where it is,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not poison any further.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall remain!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His absolute 'shall'?<br /><br />COMINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Twas from the canon.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Shall'!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O good but most unwise patricians! why,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You grave but reckless senators, have you thus<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given Hydra here to choose an officer,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And make your channel his? If he have power<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be not as common fools; if you are not,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If they be senators: and they are no less,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His popular 'shall' against a graver bench<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To know, when two authorities are up,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither supreme, how soon confusion<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The one by the other.<br /><br />COMINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, on to the market-place.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometime in Greece,--<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, well, no more of that.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though there the people had more absolute power,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ruin of the state.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, shall the people give<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One that speaks thus their voice?<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll give my reasons,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More worthier than their voices. They know the corn<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was not our recompense, resting well assured<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They would not thread the gates. This kind of service<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which they have often made against the senate,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All cause unborn, could never be the motive<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How shall this bisson multitude digest<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are the greater poll, and in true fear<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The nature of our seats and make the rabble<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call our cares fears; which will in time<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The crows to peck the eagles.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, enough.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enough, with over-measure.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, take more:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What may be sworn by, both divine and human,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seal what I end withal! This double worship,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where one part does disdain with cause, the other<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cannot conclude but by the yea and no<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of general ignorance,--it must omit<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Real necessities, and give way the while<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it follows,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You that will be less fearful than discreet,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That love the fundamental part of state<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A noble life before a long, and wish<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To jump a body with a dangerous physic<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of that integrity which should become't,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not having the power to do the good it would,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the in which doth control't.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has said enough.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As traitors do.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What should the people do with these bald tribunes?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On whom depending, their obedience fails<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the greater bench: in a rebellion,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then were they chosen: in a better hour,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let what is meet be said it must be meet,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And throw their power i' the dust.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manifest treason!<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This a consul? no.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The aediles, ho!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter an AEdile<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let him be apprehended.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go, call the people:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit AEdile<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in whose name myself<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And follow to thine answer.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, old goat!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senators, &amp; C We'll surety him.<br /><br />COMINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aged sir, hands off.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of thy garments.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help, ye citizens!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter a rabble of Citizens (Plebeians), with the AEdiles<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On both sides more respect.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's he that would take from you all your power.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seize him, AEdiles!<br /><br />Citizens<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down with him! down with him!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senators, &amp; C Weapons, weapons, weapons!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They all bustle about CORIOLANUS, crying<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!'<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is about to be? I am out of breath;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confusion's near; I cannot speak.

Have you an army ready, say you?<br /><br />Volsce<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A most royal one; the centurions and their charges,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and to be on foot at an hour's warning.<br /><br />Roman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; man, I think, that shall set them in present action.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.<br /><br />Volsce<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You take my part from me, sir; I have the most cause<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be glad of yours.<br /><br />Roman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, let us go together.</span><span id = 18351 >SCENE IV. Antium. Before Aufidius's house.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter CORIOLANUS in mean apparel, disguised and muffled <br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A goodly city is this Antium. City,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In puny battle slay me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter a Citizen<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Save you, sir.<br /><br />Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Direct me, if it be your will,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?<br /><br />Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is, and feasts the nobles of the state<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At his house this night.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which is his house, beseech you?<br /><br />Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, here before you.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, sir: farewell.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Citizen<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unseparable, shall within this hour,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a dissension of a doit, break out<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To take the one the other, by some chance,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And interjoin their issues. So with me:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This enemy town.

Now this extremity<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mistake me not--to save my life, for if<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be full quit of those my banishers,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of shame seen through thy country, speed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thee straight,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That my revengeful services may prove<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As benefits to thee, for I will fight<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against my canker'd country with the spleen<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of all the under fiends. But if so be<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Longer to live most weary, and present<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And cannot live but to thy shame, unless<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It be to do thee service.<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O Marcius, Marcius!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should from yond cloud speak divine things,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mine arms about that body, where against<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My grained ash an hundred times hath broke<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The anvil of my sword, and do contest<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As hotly and as nobly with thy love<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As ever in ambitious strength I did<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I loved the maid I married; never man<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than when I first my wedded mistress saw<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a power on foot; and I had purpose<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twelve several times, and I have nightly since<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been down together in my sleep,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From twelve to seventy, and pouring war<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And take our friendly senators by the hands;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who am prepared against your territories,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though not for Rome itself.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You bless me, gods!<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The leading of thine own revenges, take<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The one half of my commission; and set down--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or rudely visit them in parts remote,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me commend thee first to those that shall<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And more a friend than e'er an enemy;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS. The two Servingmen come forward<br /><br />First Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's a strange alteration!<br /><br />Second Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; false report of him.<br /><br />First Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What an arm he has! he turned me about with his<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.<br /><br />Second Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cannot tell how to term it.<br /><br />First Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but I thought there was more in him than I could think.<br /><br />Second Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; man i' the world.<br /><br />First Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.<br /><br />Second Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who, my master?<br /><br />First Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay, it's no matter for that.<br /><br />Second Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worth six on him.<br /><br />First Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; greater soldier.<br /><br />Second Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.<br /><br />First Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ay, and for an assault too.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Re-enter third Servingman<br /><br />Third Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!<br /><br />First Servingman Second Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What, what, what? let's partake.<br /><br />Third Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lieve be a condemned man.<br /><br />First Servingman Second Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherefore? wherefore?<br /><br />Third Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Caius Marcius.<br /><br />First Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you say 'thwack our general '?<br /><br />Third Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good enough for him.<br /><br />Second Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.<br /><br />First Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him like a carbon ado.<br /><br />Second Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An he had been cannibally given, he might have<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; broiled and eaten him too.<br /><br />First Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, more of thy news?<br /><br />Third Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; question asked him by any of the senators, but they<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stand bald before him: our general himself makes a<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the middle and but one half of what he was<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.<br /><br />Second Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.<br /><br />Third Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.<br /><br />First Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Directitude! what's that?<br /><br />Third Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the man in blood, they will out of their<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him.<br /><br />First Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when goes this forward?<br /><br />Third Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wipe their lips.<br /><br />Second Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tailors, and breed ballad-makers.<br /><br />First Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.<br /><br />Second Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; great maker of cuckolds.<br /><br />First Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ay, and it makes men hate one another.<br /><br />Third Servingman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reason; because they then less need one another.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wars for my money.

Tullus Aufidius,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second name of men, obeys his points<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As if he were his officer: desperation<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is all the policy, strength and defence,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That Rome can make against them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter a troop of Citizens<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here come the clusters.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And is Aufidius with him? You are they<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That made the air unwholesome, when you cast<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And not a hair upon a soldier's head<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you threw caps up will he tumble down,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if he could burn us all into one coal,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have deserved it.<br /><br />Citizens<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faith, we hear fearful news.<br /><br />First Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For mine own part,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.<br /><br />Second Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so did I.<br /><br />Third Citizen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it was against our will.<br /><br />COMINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye re goodly things, you voices!<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have made<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good work, you and your cry!

A camp, at a small distance from Rome.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter AUFIDIUS and his Lieutenant <br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do they still fly to the Roman?<br /><br />Lieutenant<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you are darken'd in this action, sir,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even by your own.<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot help it now,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless, by using means, I lame the foot<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even to my person, than I thought he would<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When first I did embrace him: yet his nature<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that's no changeling; and I must excuse<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What cannot be amended.<br /><br />Lieutenant<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet I wish, sir,--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean for your particular,--you had not<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Join'd in commission with him; but either<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had borne the action of yourself, or else<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To him had left it solely.<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand thee well; and be thou sure,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when he shall come to his account, he knows not<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I can urge against him. Although it seems,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so he thinks, and is no less apparent<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whene'er we come to our account.<br /><br />Lieutenant<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All places yield to him ere he sits down;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the nobility of Rome are his:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The senators and patricians love him too:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By sovereignty of nature. First he was<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A noble servant to them; but he could not<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which out of daily fortune ever taints<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The happy man; whether defect of judgment,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To fail in the disposing of those chances<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which he was lord of; or whether nature,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not to be other than one thing, not moving<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even with the same austerity and garb<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he controll'd the war; but one of these--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he hath spices of them all, not all,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lie in the interpretation of the time:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And power, unto itself most commendable,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To extol what it hath done.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.</span><span id = 18355 >SCENE I. Rome.

He call'd me father:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A mile before his tent fall down, and knee<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.<br /><br />COMINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He would not seem to know me.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you hear?<br /><br />COMINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet one time he did call me by my name:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That we have bled together. Coriolanus<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He would not answer to: forbad all names;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was a kind of nothing, titleless,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of burning Rome.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, so: you have made good work!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!<br /><br />COMINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it was less expected: he replied,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a bare petition of a state<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To one whom they had punish'd.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very well:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could he say less?<br /><br />COMINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I offer'd to awaken his regard<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For's private friends: his answer to me was,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He could not stay to pick them in a pile<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And still to nose the offence.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For one poor grain or two!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this so never-needed help, yet do not<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than the instant army we can make,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Might stop our countryman.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, I'll not meddle.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pray you, go to him.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What should I do?<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only make trial what your love can do<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Rome, towards Marcius.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, and say that Marcius<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Return me, as Cominius is return'd,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unheard; what then?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as a discontented friend, grief-shot<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With his unkindness? say't be so?<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet your good will<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you intended well.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll undertake 't:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was not taken well; he had not dined:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We pout upon the morning, are unapt<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These and these conveyances of our blood<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till he be dieted to my request,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then I'll set upon him.<br /><br />BRUTUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know the very road into his kindness,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And cannot lose your way.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good faith, I'll prove him,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speed how it will.

Entrance of the Volscian camp before Rome.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two Sentinels on guard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter to them, MENENIUS<br /><br />First Senator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stay: whence are you?<br /><br />Second Senator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stand, and go back.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am an officer of state, and come<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To speak with Coriolanus.<br /><br />First Senator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From whence?<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From Rome.<br /><br />First Senator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may not pass, you must return: our general<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will no more hear from thence.<br /><br />Second Senator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'll speak with Coriolanus.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good my friends,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have heard your general talk of Rome,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.<br /><br />First Senator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is not here passable.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tell thee, fellow,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The general is my lover: I have been<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book of his good acts, whence men have read<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His name unparallel'd, haply amplified;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For I have ever verified my friends,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must have leave to pass.<br /><br />First Senator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; always factionary on the party of your general.<br /><br />Second Senator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have, I am one that, telling true under him, must<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speak with him till after dinner.<br /><br />First Senator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are a Roman, are you?<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am, as thy general is.<br /><br />First Senator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when you have pushed out your gates the very<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; defender of them, and, in a violent popular<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; front his revenges with the easy groans of old<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you out of reprieve and pardon.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; use me with estimation.<br /><br />Second Senator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, my captain knows you not.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, thy general.<br /><br />First Senator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lest<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that's<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the utmost of your having: back.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay, but, fellow, fellow,--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the matter?<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with him, if thou standest not i' the state of<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hanging, or of some death more long in<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To CORIOLANUS<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thee; but being assured none but myself could move<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thee, I have been blown out of your gates with<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; here,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; access to thee.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Away!<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How! away!<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are servanted to others: though I owe<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My revenge properly, my remission lies<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mine ears against your suits are stronger than<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take this along; I writ it for thy sake<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gives a letter<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You keep a constant temper.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS<br /><br />First Senator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, sir, is your name Menenius?<br /><br />Second Senator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; way home again.<br /><br />First Senator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; greatness back?<br /><br />Second Senator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I neither care for the world nor your general: for<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; such things as you, I can scarce think there's any,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; himself fears it not from another: let your general<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your misery increase with your age! I say to you,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as I was said to, Away!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit<br /><br />First Senator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A noble fellow, I warrant him.<br /><br />Second Senator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock, the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oak not to be wind-shaken.</span><span id = 18357 >SCENE III. The tent of Coriolanus.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter CORIOLANUS, AUFIDIUS, and others <br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set down our host. My partner in this action,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have borne this business.<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only their ends<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have respected; stopp'd your ears against<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The general suit of Rome; never admitted<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A private whisper, no, not with such friends<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That thought them sure of you.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This last old man,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loved me above the measure of a father;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was to send him; for whose old love I have,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first conditions, which they did refuse<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And cannot now accept; to grace him only<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That thought he could do more, a very little<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shout within<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the same time 'tis made? I will not.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter in mourning habits, VIRGILIA, VOLUMNIA, leading young MARCIUS, VALERIA, and Attendants<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All bond and privilege of nature, break!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As if Olympus to a molehill should<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In supplication nod: and my young boy<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath an aspect of intercession, which<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As if a man were author of himself<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And knew no other kin.<br /><br />VIRGILIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My lord and husband!<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.<br /><br />VIRGILIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sorrow that delivers us thus changed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Makes you think so.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a dull actor now,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have forgot my part, and I am out,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgive my tyranny; but do not say<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the most noble mother of the world<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kneels<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of thy deep duty more impression show<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than that of common sons.<br /><br />VOLUMNIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O, stand up blest!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I kneel before thee; and unproperly<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Show duty, as mistaken all this while<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between the child and parent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kneels<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is this?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your knees to me? to your corrected son?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Murdering impossibility, to make<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What cannot be, slight work.<br /><br />VOLUMNIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou art my warrior;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The noble sister of Publicola,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's curdied by the frost from purest snow<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!<br /><br />VOLUMNIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a poor epitome of yours,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which by the interpretation of full time<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May show like all yourself.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The god of soldiers,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the consent of supreme Jove, inform<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And saving those that eye thee!<br /><br />VOLUMNIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your knee, sirrah.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's my brave boy!<br /><br />VOLUMNIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are suitors to you.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I beseech you, peace:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, if you'ld ask, remember this before:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thing I have forsworn to grant may never<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be held by you denials. Do not bid me<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ally my rages and revenges with<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your colder reasons.<br /><br />VOLUMNIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O, no more, no more!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have said you will not grant us any thing;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For we have nothing else to ask, but that<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which you deny already: yet we will ask;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That, if you fail in our request, the blame<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?<br /><br />VOLUMNIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And state of bodies would bewray what life<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How more unfortunate than all living women<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are we come hither: since that thy sight,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which should<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with comforts,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Making the mother, wife and child to see<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The son, the husband and the father tearing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His country's bowels out. And to poor we<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That all but we enjoy; for how can we,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alas, how can we for our country pray.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our comfort in the country. We must find<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An evident calamity, though we had<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our wish, which side should win: for either thou<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must, as a foreign recreant, be led<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With manacles thorough our streets, or else<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And bear the palm for having bravely shed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I purpose not to wait on fortune till<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather to show a noble grace to both parts<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; March to assault thy country than to tread--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That brought thee to this world.<br /><br />VIRGILIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ay, and mine,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Living to time.<br /><br />Young MARCIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A' shall not tread on me;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not of a woman's tenderness to be,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have sat too long.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rising<br /><br />VOLUMNIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay, go not from us thus.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it were so that our request did tend<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To save the Romans, thereby to destroy<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This we received;' and each in either side<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But with his last attempt he wiped it out;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Destroy'd his country, and his name remains<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To imitate the graces of the gods;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps thy childishness will move him more<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And spurn me back: but if it be not so,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That thou restrain'st from me the duty which<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the last: so we will home to Rome,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This boy, that cannot tell what he would have<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does reason our petition with more strength<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His wife is in Corioli and his child<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then I'll speak a little.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He holds her by the hand, silent<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O mother, mother!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gods look down, and this unnatural scene<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have won a happy victory to Rome;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If not most mortal to him. But, let it come.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were you in my stead, would you have heard<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was moved withal.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dare be sworn you were:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, sir, it is no little thing to make<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Aside] I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thy honour<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At difference in thee: out of that I'll work<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Myself a former fortune.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ladies make signs to CORIOLANUS<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ay, by and by;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, &amp; c<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we will drink together; and you shall bear<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A better witness back than words, which we,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To have a temple built you: all the swords<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Italy, and her confederate arms,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could not have made this peace.</span><span id = 18358 >SCENE IV.

A public place.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter MENENIUS and SICINIUS <br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; corner-stone?<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, what of that?<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it be possible for you to displace it with your<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; little finger, there is some hope the ladies of<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I say there is no hope in't: our throats are<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sentenced and stay upon execution.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is't possible that so short a time can alter the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; condition of a man!<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; creeping thing.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He loved his mother dearly.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; battery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and a heaven to throne in.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall our poor city find: and all this is long of<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gods be good unto us!<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; us. When we banished him, we respected not them;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter a Messenger<br /><br />Messenger<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hale him up and down, all swearing, if<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They'll give him death by inches.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter a second Messenger<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the news?<br /><br />Second Messenger<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friend,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?<br /><br />Second Messenger<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As certain as I know the sun is fire:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trumpets; hautboys; drums beat; all together<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make the sun dance. Hark you!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A shout within<br /><br />MENENIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is good news:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A city full; of tribunes, such as you,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This morning for ten thousand of your throats<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Music still, with shouts<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accept my thankfulness.<br /><br />Second Messenger<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have all<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great cause to give great thanks.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are near the city?<br /><br />Second Messenger<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost at point to enter.<br /><br />SICINIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will meet them,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And help the joy.</span><span id = 18359 >SCENE V. The same. A street near the gate.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter two Senators with VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, VALERIA, &amp; c. passing over the stage, followed by Patricians and others <br /><br />First Senator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cry 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!'<br /><br />All<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome, ladies, Welcome!</span><span id = 18360 >SCENE VI. Antium. A public place.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS, with Attendants <br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go tell the lords o' the city I am here:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deliver them this paper: having read it,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bid them repair to the market place; where I,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The city ports by this hath enter'd and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intends to appear before the people, hoping<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To purge herself with words: dispatch.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exeunt Attendants<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter three or four Conspirators of AUFIDIUS' faction<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most welcome!<br /><br />First Conspirator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How is it with our general?<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with his charity slain.<br /><br />Second Conspirator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most noble sir,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you do hold the same intent wherein<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of your great danger.<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I cannot tell:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must proceed as we do find the people.<br /><br />Third Conspirator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people will remain uncertain whilst<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Makes the survivor heir of all.<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know it;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And my pretext to strike at him admits<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He bow'd his nature, never known before<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But to be rough, unswayable and free.<br /><br />Third Conspirator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, his stoutness<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he did stand for consul, which he lost<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By lack of stooping,--<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That I would have spoke of:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all his own desires; nay, let him choose<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My best and freshest men; served his designments<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In mine own person; holp to reap the fame<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which he did end all his; and took some pride<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I seem'd his follower, not partner, and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He waged me with his countenance, as if<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been mercenary.<br /><br />First Conspirator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So he did, my lord:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he had carried Rome and that we look'd<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For no less spoil than glory,--<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was it:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a few drops of women's rheum, which are<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of our great action: therefore shall he die,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drums and trumpets sound, with great shouts of the People<br /><br />First Conspirator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your native town you enter'd like a post,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And had no welcomes home: but he returns,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Splitting the air with noise.<br /><br />Second Conspirator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And patient fools,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With giving him glory.<br /><br />Third Conspirator<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, at your vantage,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere he express himself, or move the people<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With what he would say, let him feel your sword,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which we will second. When he lies along,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After your way his tale pronounced shall bury<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His reasons with his body.<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say no more:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here come the lords.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter the Lords of the city<br /><br />All The Lords<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are most welcome home.<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have not deserved it.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I have written to you?<br /><br />Lords<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have.<br /><br />First Lord<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And grieve to hear't.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What faults he made before the last, I think<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Might have found easy fines: but there to end<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where he was to begin and give away<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The benefit of our levies, answering us<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With our own charge, making a treaty where<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He approaches: you shall hear him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter CORIOLANUS, marching with drum and colours; commoners being with him<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No more infected with my country's love<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under your great command. You are to know<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That prosperously I have attempted and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With bloody passage led your wars even to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do more than counterpoise a full third part<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The charges of the action. We have made peace<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With no less honour to the Antiates<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Together with the seal o' the senate, what<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have compounded on.<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read it not, noble lords;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hath abused your powers.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traitor! how now!<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ay, traitor, Marcius!<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marcius!<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coriolanus in Corioli?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has betray'd your business, and given up,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breaking his oath and resolution like<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A twist of rotten silk, never admitting<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He whined and roar'd away your victory,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That pages blush'd at him and men of heart<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look'd wondering each at other.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear'st thou, Mars?<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Name not the god, thou boy of tears!<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ha!<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No more.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To thrust the lie unto him.<br /><br />First Lord<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peace, both, and hear me speak.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alone I did it. Boy!<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, noble lords,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Fore your own eyes and ears?<br /><br />All Conspirators<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let him die for't.<br /><br />All The People<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marcus.' 'He killed my father.'<br /><br />Second Lord<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man is noble and his fame folds-in<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And trouble not the peace.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O that I had him,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To use my lawful sword!<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Insolent villain!<br /><br />All Conspirators<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Conspirators draw, and kill CORIOLANUS: AUFIDIUS stands on his body<br /><br />Lords<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hold, hold, hold, hold!<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My noble masters, hear me speak.<br /><br />First Lord<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O Tullus,--<br /><br />Second Lord<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.<br /><br />Third Lord<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put up your swords.<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provoked by him, you cannot--the great danger<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To call me to your senate, I'll deliver<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Myself your loyal servant, or endure<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your heaviest censure.<br /><br />First Lord<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bear from hence his body;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And mourn you for him: let him be regarded<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the most noble corse that ever herald<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did follow to his urn.<br /><br />Second Lord<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His own impatience<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's make the best of it.<br /><br />AUFIDIUS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My rage is gone;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which to this hour bewail the injury,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet he shall have a noble memory.
