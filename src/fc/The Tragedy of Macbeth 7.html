But we know that the play was already in the repertory of the King&rsquo;s Men by 1610. In April of that year, the astrologer Simon Forman saw the play at the Globe Theater, the King&rsquo;s Men&rsquo;s main venue, and recorded his impressions in his &ldquo;Book of Plays,&rdquo; a journal he was keeping at the time. By 1610, however, Shakespeare had begun his gradual retirement, spending more time in his hometown of Stratford-upon-Avon than in the hustle and bustle of the London theatre.<br /><br />It is likely that the play had been in the company&rsquo;s repertory for a few years by the time Forman saw it. Thematically and formally, &ldquo;Macbeth&rdquo; resembles much more the plays that he had been writing between 1599 and 1608 (&ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo; &ldquo;Henry V,&rdquo; &ldquo;Othello,&rdquo; &ldquo;King Lear,&rdquo; &ldquo;Antony and Cleopatra&rdquo;) than anything earlier (&ldquo;Comedy of Errors,&rdquo; &ldquo;Richard III&rdquo;) or later (&ldquo;Winter&rsquo;s Tale,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Tempest&rdquo;).<br /><h4>Did Shakespeare write &ldquo;Macbeth&rdquo; for King James?</h4>There is no evidence that the king of England, the most important political and religious figure in Britain, ever communicated directly with Shakespeare about his theatrical work.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.electricscotland.com/history/scotland/images/king_james.jpg" border="0" height="340" width="249" /><br /><i>King James of England and Scotland</i><br /><br />Because the play is set in Scotland and three witches are important characters, scholars have decided that Shakespeare wrote the play after March, 1603, when king James of Scotland inherited the English throne and became monarch of both kingdoms. James had written a treatise about witchcraft (the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/kjd/">&ldquo;Daemonologie&rdquo;</a> ) and was interested enough in the matter to rearrange his busy schedule so he could attend the trials of people accused of sorcery and necromancy.<br /><h4>Did Shakespeare write &ldquo;Macbeth&rdquo; to commemorate the Gunpowder Plot?</h4>Scholars have made much of the comic scene with the porter (the beginning of II.3) and his reference to an &ldquo;equivocator&rdquo; who has arrived in hell. The word "equivocator" generally means any person who speaks ambiguously, like the witches with their riddles and paradoxes, or the clowns with their word-play and other verbal comedy. After November 1605, however, the word gained a new, more specific meaning.<br /><br />Shortly before November 5, a plot was discovered by King James: several Catholic noblemen and their servants were accused of attempting to blow up the buildings where Parliament was due to be held in Westminster, killing the representatives of the whole kingdom, most officers of the crown, and the entire royal family. This "Gunpowder Plot" was on everyone's mind in late 1605 and most of 1606.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.show.me.uk/gunpowderplot/images/pictures/img_77_lrg.jpg" border="0" height="252" width="323" /><br /><i>"The Double Deliverance," 1621 engraving showing the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot and comparing it with the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588.</i><br /><br />During one of the trials of those accused of masterminding the plot, the testimony of Henry Garnet, a Jesuit priest, was compromised by the fact that he had previously written a treatise on "equivocation," a controversial doctrine that contended that Catholics were allowed to lie to certain government officials (like Protestant judges for example), as long as they answered truthfully in their minds to God himself. The porter's reference has led most scholars to postulate that Shakespeare must have written Macbeth after early 1606 (the date of Garnet's trial), possible shortly after that, when the reference would have been fresh in playgoers' minds.<br /><h4>What are the differences and similarities between the &ldquo;Macbeth&rdquo; that Shakespeare wrote and his company acted around 1606 and the play that was printed by his colleagues and friends in 1623?</h4>Nobody knows. Answers are extremely conjectural and depend on very tangential references and shaky assumptions about Shakespeare, his position as an actor in a royally sponsored company, his relationship to the king, his desire to comment on political matters, on political theory or theology, etc.<br /><br />A very famous contextual answer was provided by the scholar Henry Paul in 1950s, who claimed that Macbeth was a &ldquo;royal play,&rdquo; especially devised by Shakespeare to entertain the court during the royal visit of king Christian of Denmark, James&rsquo;s brother-in-law, in the summer of 1606 (this explanation also makes a compelling case for the &ldquo;equivocator&rdquo; reference being fresh among the audience).<br /><h4>Are there sections of the 1623 Macbeth that were not written by Shakespeare?</h4>Yes. One of the few things that are fairly agreed upon about the 1623 text is that it interpolates a couple of sections that were not written by Shakespeare (most of III.5 and part of V.1), both featuring the character of Hecate, queen of the witches, and song-and-dance numbers. These scenes are notorious among scholars because they highlight the problems one encounters when trying to identify the "true" text of a Shakespearean play, or when trying to figure out "what Shakespeare actually wrote."<br /><br />Many years ago, it was noticed that the songs in the Hecate scenes were identical to songs in "The Witch," a play written by fellow playwright Thomas Middleton sometime between 1610 and 1615. Further analysis of the tone and meter of those scenes confirmed the initial impression that Shakespeare did not write them.<br /><br />The scholarly consensus is that Shakespeare wrote "Macbeth" around 1606, but sometime before 1623 (when the First Folio was published) Shakespeare's company somehow had "Macbeth" revised for performance by someone else (possibly Middleton himself), who then grafted a couple of crowd-pleasing scenes and songs from Middleton&rsquo;s "The Witch" onto it.<br /><br />Bearing all this in mind, however, there can be no doubt that by 1623 the text we now have was what the King&rsquo;s Men, a company that still included many men who had worked closely with Shakespeare, were using at the time to entertain the playgoing public and that it bore at least some similitude to that play they had first performed almost two decades before.<br /><h4>Where did Shakespeare get the basic plot of &ldquo;Macbeth&rdquo;?</h4>For most of his plays, and particularly for his tragedies, Shakespeare&rsquo;s working method used as a point of departure for the plot some story he had read in a book. Shakespeare, though very likely not a book collector or even owner, read voraciously and had an astonishing ability for identifying words, phrases, situations, or wholesale plots that would be suitable for the crafting of his plays.<br /><br />It is accepted that Shakespeare found Macbeth in a very popular book called &ldquo;Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland,&rdquo; credited to one Raphael Holinshed. The book was first published in 1577 and was actually written by Holinshed, William Harrison, and Richard Stanyhurst, who in turn combed through many other histories to compose their book. Holinshed died in 1580, but the work was so popular that a second edition was published in 1587. The 1587 edition, the one Shakespeare would have read, was heavily revised. It is generally considered a completely different work, one little affected by the late Holinshed, who nevertheless remained on the title page (very likely for marketing reasons). This has led many people to write that Shakespeare used &ldquo;Holinshed&rdquo; (with the quotation marks), to differentiate the 1587 book from the dead writer.<br /><br />The history of Scotland in &ldquo;Holinshed&rsquo;s Chronicles&rdquo; includes <a href="http://www.clicknotes.com/macbeth/Holinshed/">a</a><a target="_blank" href="http://www.clicknotes.com/macbeth/Holinshed/">n account of the reigns of Duncane and Makbeth,</a> who ruled the northern kingdom in the middle of the 11th century (more than 500 years before Shakespeare wrote &ldquo;Macbeth&rdquo;).<br /><h4>What did &ldquo;Holinshed&rsquo;s Chronicles&rdquo; say about Macbeth&rsquo;s period as Duncan&rsquo;s loyal thane?</h4>Makbeth is first mentioned in the passage about his cousin Duncane becoming king, where he is described as &ldquo;a valiant gentleman&rdquo; though somewhat &ldquo;cruel of nature.&rdquo; Duncane, in contrast, was &ldquo;soft and gentle of nature.&rdquo; Duncane&rsquo;s kindness over the years, however, led to a deterioration of his authority and &ldquo;many misruled persons took occasion [...] to trouble the peace and quiet state of the commonwealth by seditious commotions.&rdquo;<br /><br />One of these revolts was led by Makdowald, who rallied his supporters with slanderous words about Duncane. The king, Makdowald said, was but &ldquo;a faint-hearted milksop, more meet to govern a sort of idle monks in some cloister, than to have the rule of such valiant and hardy men of war as the Scots.&rdquo; Soon, Makdowald had gathered a rebel army, aided by &ldquo; no small number of Kernes and Galloglasses&rdquo; from Ireland.<br /><br />According to the &ldquo;Chronicles,&rdquo; Duncane, unable to deal with Makdowald&rsquo;s threat by his own dwindling authority, called a meeting of his noblemen. Makbeth, &ldquo;speaking much against the kings softness, and overmuch slackness in punishing offenders&rdquo; promised to defeat the rebels if he and his friend Banquho, another thane who had faced revolts against Duncane before, were given the authority to do so. They were, and Makbeth defeated the rebels, and drove Makdowald&rsquo;s back to his castle, where the desperate outlaw killed his family before killing himself. &ldquo;Thus was justice and law restored again to the old accustomed course,&rdquo; says the chronicle, &ldquo;by the diligent means of Makbeth.&rdquo;<br /><br />But immediately after the suppression of Makdowald&rsquo;s revolt, &ldquo;word came that Sueno king of Norway was arrived in Fife with a puissant army, to subdue the whole realm of Scotland.&rdquo; Uncharacteristically, Duncane &ldquo;set all slothful and lingering delays apart, and began to assemble an army in most sp&eacute;edy wise, like a very valiant captain.&rdquo; He split his army in three battalions: one led by Makbeth, another by Banquho, and the third by the king himself.<br /><br />Sueno, however, won the first battle and managed to besiege Duncane in a castle. The king tricked Sueno&rsquo;s army into eating the sleep-inducing &ldquo;mekilwoort berries&rdquo; and then called on Makbeth for relief. Makbeth &ldquo;making no delay, came with his people to the place, where his enemies were lodged, and first killing the watch, afterwards entered the camp, and made such slaughter on all sides without any resistance, that it was a wonderful matter to behold, for the Danes were so heavy of sleep, that the most part of them were slain and never stirred: other that were awakened either by the noise or other ways forth, were so amazed and dizzy-headed upon their wakening, that they were not able to make any defense: so that of the whole number there escaped no more but only Sueno himself and ten other persons, by whose help he got to his ships.&rdquo;<br /><br />Shortly after that, Makbeth and Banquho also defeated an invasion by Canute, the Danish king of England.<br /><h4>What did &ldquo;Holinshed&rsquo;s Chronicles&rdquo; say about Macbeth and the supernatural prophecies?</h4>After Makbeth has saved the kingdom from foreign invaders, the chronicle continues, there &ldquo;happened a strange and uncouth wonder, which afterward was the cause of much trouble in the realm of Scotland [...]. It fortuned as Makbeth and Banquho journeyed towards Fores, where the king then lay, they went sporting by the way together without other company, save only themselves, passing thorough the woods and fields, when suddenly in the midst of a land&nbsp; there met them three women in strange and wild apparel, resembling creatures of elder world, whom when they attentively beheld, wondering much at the sight, the first of them spake and said; &lsquo;All hail Makbeth, thane of Glammis&rsquo; (for he had lately entered into that dignity and office by the death of his father Sinell.) The second of them said; &lsquo;Hail Makbeth thane of Cawder.&rsquo; But the third said; &lsquo;All hail Makbeth that hereafter shall be king of Scotland.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /><br /><img src="http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/Library/SLT/images/Witches.JPG" alt="Engraving of the weird sisters in " title="Engraving of the weird sisters in " holinshed="" s="" chronicle="" border="0" /><br /><i>Engraving showing Makbeth meeting the weird sisters in "Holinshed's Chronicle"</i><br /><br />Banquho then asked them &ldquo;&lsquo;What manner of women [...] are you, that seem so little favorable unto me, whereas to my fellow here, besides high offices, you assign also the kingdom, appointing forth nothing for me at all?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes (said the first of them) we promise greater benefits unto thee, than unto him, for he shall reign in deed, but with an unlucky end: neither shall he leave any issue behind him to succeed in his place, where contrarily thou in deed shall not reign at all, but of thee those shall be borne which shall govern the Scottish kingdom by long order of continual descent.&rsquo; Herewith the foresaid women vanished immediately out of their sight.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;This was reputed at the first,&rdquo; the chronicle continues, &ldquo;but some vain fantastical illusion by Mackbeth [sic] and Banquho, insomuch that Banquho would call Mackbeth in jest, king of Scotland; and Mackbeth again would call him in sport likewise, the father of many kings. But afterwards the common opinion was, that these women were either the weird sisters, that is (as you would say) the goddesses of destiny, or else some nymphs or fairies, indued with knowledge of prophesy by their necromantical science, because everything came to pass as they had spoken.&rdquo;<br /><br />The first part of the prophecy proved correct shortly after the strange meeting: &ldquo;the thane of Cawder being condemned at Fores of treason against the king committed; his lands, livings, and offices were given of the kings liberality to Mackbeth. The same night after, at supper, Banquho jested with him and said: &lsquo;Now Mackbeth thou hast obtained those things which the two former sisters prophesied, there remaineth only for thee to purchase that which the third said should come to pass.&rsquo; Whereupon Mackbeth revolving the thing in his mind, began even then to devise how he might attain to the kingdom: but yet he thought with himself that he must tarry a time, which should advance him thereto (by the divine providence) as it had come to passe in his former preferment.&rdquo;<br /><h4>What did &ldquo;Holinshed&rsquo;s Chronicles&rdquo; say about Macbeth&rsquo;s decision to assassinate Duncan?</h4>While Mackbeth tarried, Duncane made his elder son Malcolme prince of Cumberland, &ldquo;as it were thereby to appoint him his successor in the kingdom, immediately after his decease. Mackbeth sore troubled herewith, for that he saw by this means his hope sore hindered (where, by the old laws of the realm, the ordinance was, that if he that should succeed were not of able age to take the charge upon himself, he that was next of blood unto him should be admitted) he began to take counsel how he might usurpe the kingdom by force, having a just quarrel so to do (as he took the matter) for that Duncane did what in him lay to defraud him of all manner of title and claim, which he might in time to come, pretend unto the crown. The words of the three weird sisters also [...] greatly encouraged him hereunto, but especially his wife lay sore upon him to attempt the thing, as she that was very ambitious, burning in unquenchable desire to bear the name of a queen.&rdquo;<br /><br />Mackbeth communicated &ldquo;his purposed intent with his trusty friends, amongst whom Banquho was the chiefest,&rdquo; and &ldquo;upon confidence of their promised aid, he slew the king at Enuerns, or (as some say) at Botgosuane, in the sixth year of his reign [sic]. Then having a company about him of such as he had made privy to his enterprise, he caused himself to be proclaimed king, and forthwith went unto Scone, where (by common consent) he received the investiture of the kingdom according to the accustomed manner.&rdquo;<br /><br />Malcolme Cammore and Donald Bane, the sons of king Duncane, &ldquo;for fear of their lives (which they might well know that Mackbeth would seek to bring to end for his more sure confirmation in the estate) fled into Cumberland, where Malcolme remained, till time that saint Edward the son of Ethelred recovered the dominion of England from the Danish power, the which Edward received Malcolme by way of most friendly entertainment: but Donald passed over into Ireland, where he was tenderly cherished by the king of that land.&rdquo;<br /><h4>What did &ldquo;Holinshed&rsquo;s Chronicles&rdquo; say about Macbeth&rsquo;s tenure as king of Scotland?</h4>Unlike Shakespeare&rsquo;s Macbeth, haunted by his crime from the get-go, according to Holinshed&rsquo;s Chronicles Mackbeth&rsquo;s rule was initially far more successful than Duncane&rsquo;s.<br /><br />The new king smartly &ldquo;used great liberality towards the nobles of the realm, thereby to win their favor, and when he saw that no man went about to trouble him, he set his whole intention to maintain justice, and to punish all enormities and abuses, which had chanced through the feeble and slothful administration of Duncane. And to bring his purpose the better to pass without any trouble or great business, he devised a subtle wile to bring all offenders and misdoers unto justice, soliciting sundry of his liege people with high rewards, to challenge and appeal such as most oppressed the commons, to come at a day and place appointed, to fight singular combats within barriers, in trial of their accusations. When these thieves, &lsquo;barrettors&rsquo; [corrupt officials] and other oppressors of the innocent people were come to darren [ultimate] battle in this wise (as is said) they were straight ways apprehended by armed men, and trussed up in halters on gibbets, according as they had justly deserved.&rdquo;<br /><br />In fact, Mackbeth was so efficient at combatting crime &ldquo;that many years after all theft and &lsquo;reiffings&rsquo; [robberies] were little heard of, the people enjoying the blissful benefit of good peace and tranquillity. Mackbeth showing himself thus a most diligent punisher of all injuries and wrongs attempted by any disordered persons within his realm, was accounted the sure defense and &lsquo;buckler&rsquo; [shield] of innocent people; and hereto he also applied his whole endeavor, to cause young men to exercise themselves in virtuous manners, and men of the church to attend their divine service according to their vocations.&rdquo;<br /><br />And although the turmoil caused by noblemen (endemic in Scotland) continued unabated--Mackbeth had to execute &ldquo;sundry thanes, as of Cathnes, Sutherland, Stranauerne, and Ros--&ldquo;Holinshed&rsquo;s Chronicle&rdquo; presents Mackbeth as an exemplary king for most of his rule, one who, &ldquo;if he had attained [the crown] by rightful means, and continued in uprightness of justice as he began, till the end of his reign, he might well have been numbered amongst the most noble princes that any where had reigned.&rdquo; This glorious period of his rule lasted for ten years.<br /><h4>Why, according to &ldquo;Holinshed&rsquo;s Chronicle&rdquo; did Macbeth&rsquo;s rule begin to deteriorate after a decade of good government?</h4>The chronicle had already mentioned Mackbeth&rsquo;s &ldquo;cruel nature,&rdquo; an essential part of himself that he had kept in check during those ten years &ldquo;to purchase [...] the favor of the people.&rdquo; But eventually and inevitably &ldquo;he began to show what he was, in stead of equity practicing cruelty. For the prick of conscience (as it chanceth ever in tyrants, and such as attain to any estate by unrighteous means) caused him ever to fear, least he should be served of the same cup, as he had ministered to his predecessor. The words also of the three weird sisters, would not out of his mind, which as they promised him the kingdom, so likewise did they promise it at the same time unto the posterity of Banquho.&rdquo;<br /><br />Mackbeth &ldquo;willed therefore the same Banquho with his son named Fleance, to come to a supper that he had prepared for them which was in deed, as he had devised, present death at the hands of certain murderers, whom he hired to execute that deed, appointing them to meet with the same Banquho and his son without the palace, as they returned to their lodgings, and there to slay them, so that he would not have his house slandered, but that in time to come he might clear himself, if any thing were laid to his charge upon any suspicion that might arise.&rdquo;<br /><br />But Fleance &ldquo;by the benefit of the dark night&rdquo; and &ldquo;by the help of almighty God reserving him to better fortune, escaped that danger: and afterwards having some inkling (by the admonition of some friends which he had in the court) how his life was sought no less than his father&rsquo;s, who was slain not by &lsquo;chance meddlie&rsquo; [accidental manslaughter] (as by the handling of the matter Makbeth would have had it to appear) but even upon a prepensed [premeditated] devise: whereupon to avoid further peril he fled into Wales.&rdquo; Fleance went on to become the ancestor of the house of Stewart (or Stuart), all the way up to king James of Scotland (a young king when the &ldquo;Chronicles&rdquo; were published, and not yet king of England as well).<br /><br />After the murder of Banquho &ldquo;nothing prospered with [...] Makbeth: for in manner every man began to doubt his own life, and durst unneth [scarcely] appear in the king&rsquo;s presence; and even as there were many that stood in fear of him, so likewise stood he in fear of many.&rdquo; Mackbeth began sending into exile and killing his noblemen and after a while &ldquo;his earnest thirst after blood in this behalf might in no wise be satisfied: for ye must consider he wan double profit (as he thought) hereby: for first they were rid out of the way whom he feared, and then again his coffers were enriched by their goods which were forfeited to his use, whereby he might better maintain a guard of armed men about him to defend his person from injury of them whom he had in any suspicion.&rdquo;<br /><h4>How did &ldquo;Holinshed&rsquo;s Chronicles&rdquo; describe Macbeth&rsquo;s fatal quarrel with Macduff?</h4>To protect himself even further and &ldquo;so that he might the more cruelly oppress his subjects with all tyrantlike wrongs,&rdquo; Mackbeth built &ldquo;a strong castle on the top of an high hill called Dunsinane, situate in Gowrie, ten miles from Perth, on such a proud height, that standing there aloft, a man might behold well near all the countries of Angus, Fife, Stermond, and Ernedale, as it were lying underneath him. This castle then being founded on the top of that high hill, put the realm to great charges before it was finished, for all the stuff necessary to the building, could not be brought up without much toil and business.&rdquo;<br /><br />Makbeth was determined to finish the work, and &ldquo;caused the thanes of each shire within the realm, to come and help towards the building, each man his course about. At the last, when the turn fell unto Makduffe thane of Fife to build his part, he sent workmen with all needful provision, and commanded them to show such diligence in every behalf, that no occasion might be given for the king to find fault with him, in that he came not himself as other had done, which he refused to do, for doubt least the king bearing him (as he partly understood) no great good will, would lay violent hands upon him, as he had done upon diverse other.&rdquo;<br /><br />When Makbeth did not find Makduffe helping with the construction, &ldquo;he was sore offended, and said; I perceive this man will never obey my commandments, till he be ridden with a snaffle: but I shall provide well enough for him. Neither could he afterwards abide to look upon the said Makduffe, either for that he thought his puissance over great; either else for that he had learned of certain wizards, in whose words he put great confidence (for that the prophesy had happened so right, which the three faeries or weird sisters had declared unto him) how that he ought to take heed of Makduffe, who in time to come should seek to destroy him.&rdquo;<br /><br />Mackbeth, according to the chronicle, would have had Makduffe killed immediately, but he felt he didn&rsquo;t have to because &ldquo;a certain witch, whom he had in great trust, had told that he should never be slain with man born of any woman, nor vanquished till the wood of Bernane came to the castle of Dunsinane. By this prophesy Makbeth put all fear out of his heart, supposing he might do what he would, without any fear to be punished for the same, for by the one prophesy he believed it was unpossible for any man to vanquish him, and by the other unpossible to slay him. This vain hope caused him to do many outrageous things, to the grievous oppression of his subjects.&rdquo;<br /><br />Saved by Mackbeth&rsquo;s overconfidence, &ldquo;Makduffe, to avoid peril of life, purposed with himself to passe into England, to procure Malcolme Cammore to claim the crown of Scotland. But this was not so secretly devised by Makduffe, but that Makbeth had knowledge given him thereof: for kings (as is said) have sharp sight like unto Lynx, and long ears like unto Midas. For Makbeth had in every nobleman&rsquo;s house, one sly fellow or other in fee with him, to reveal all that was said or done within the same, by which slight he oppressed the most part of the nobles of his realm. Immediately then, being advertised whereabout Makduffe went, he came hastily with a great power into Fife, and forthwith besieged the castle where Makduffe dwelled, trusting to have found him therein. They that kept the house, without any resistance opened the gates, and suffered him to enter, mistrusting none evil. But nevertheless Makbeth most cruelly caused the wife and children of Makduffe, with all other whom he found in that castle, to be slain. Also he confiscated the goods of Makduffe, proclaimed him traitor, and confined him out of all parts of his realm.&rdquo;<br /><h4>How did &ldquo;Holinshed&rsquo;s Chronicle&rdquo; describe the interview in exile between Macduff and Malcolm?</h4>Makduffe, however, had already &ldquo;escaped out of danger, and gotten into England unto Malcolme Cammore, to try what purchase he might make by means of his support, to revenge the slaughter so cruelly executed on his wife, his children, and other friends. At his coming unto Malcolme, he declared into what great misery the estate of Scotland was brought, by the detestable cruelties exercised by the tyrant Makbeth, having committed many horrible slaughters and murders, both as well of the nobles as commons, for the which he was hated right mortally of all his liege people, desiring nothing more than to be delivered of that intolerable and most heavy yoke of thralldom, which they sustained at such a caitif&rsquo;s [villain&rsquo;s] hands.<br /><br />Makduffe&rsquo;s words filled Malcolme with sorrow, but he was not sure that Makduffe had been wronged but the tyrant or whether he had been &ldquo;sent from Makbeth to betray him.&rdquo; Malcolme put the thane to a test and&nbsp; &ldquo;dissembling his mind at the first, he answered as followeth: &lsquo;I am truly very sorry for the misery chanced to my country of Scotland, but though I have never so great affection to relive the same, yet by reason of certain incurable vices, which reign in me, I am nothing meet thereto. First, such immoderate lust and voluptuous sensuality (the abominable fountain of all vices) followeth me, that if I were made king of Scots, I should seek to deflower maids and matrons, in such wise that mine intemperance should be more importable unto you, than the bloodie tyranny of Makbeth now is." Hereunto Makduffe answered: "This surely is a very evil fault, for many noble princes and kings have lost both lives and kingdoms for the same; nevertheless there are women enough in Scotland, and therefore follow my counsel. Make thy self king, and I shall convey the matter so wisely that thou shalt be so satisfied at thy pleasure in such secret wise, that no man shall be aware thereof.&rsquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Then said Malcolme, &lsquo;I am also the most avaricious creature on the earth, so that if I were king, I should seek so many ways to get lands and goods, that I would slay the most part of all the nobles of Scotland by surmised accusations, to the end I might enioy their lands, goods, and possessions; and therefore to show you what mischief may ensue on you through mine unsatiable covetousness, I will rehearse unto you a fable. There was a fox having a sore place on him overset with a swarm of flies, that continually sucked out her blood: and when one that came by and saw this manner, demanded whether she would have the flies driven beside her, she answered no: for if these flies that are already full, and by reason thereof suck not very eagerly, should be chased away, other that are empty and &lsquo;fellie an hungred&rsquo; [fierce by hunger] should light in their places, and suck out the residue of my blood far more to my grievance than these, which now being satisfied do not much annoy me. Therefore saith Malcolme, suffer me to remain where I am, least if I attain to the regiment of your realm, mine unquenchable avarice may prove such; that ye would think the displeasures which now grieve you, should seem easy in respect of the unmeasurable outrage, which might ensue through my coming amongst you."<br /><br />&ldquo;Makduffe to this made answer, &lsquo;how it was a far worse fault than the other: for avarice is the root of all mischief, and for that crime the most part of our kings have been slaine and brought to their final end. Yet notwithstanding follow my counsel, and take upon thee the crown. There is gold and riches enough in Scotland to satisfy thy greedy desire.&rsquo; Then Malcolme again, &lsquo;I am furthermore inclined to dissimulation, telling of &lsquo;leasings&rsquo; [lies], and all other kinds of deceit, so that I naturally rejoyce in nothing so much, as to betray &amp; deceive such as put any trust or confidence in my words. Then since there is nothing that more becometh a prince than constancy, verity, truth, and justice, with the other laudable fellowship of those faire and noble virtues which are comprehended only in soothfastness, and that lying utterly overthroweth the same; you see how unable I am to governe any province or region: and therefore since you have remedies to cloak and hide all the rest of my other vices, I pray you find shift to cloak this vice amongst the residue.&rsquo;"<br /><br />&ldquo;Then said Makduffe: &lsquo;This yet is the worst of all, and there I leave thee, and therefore say; Oh ye unhappy and miserable Scottishmen, which are thus scourged with so many and sundry calamities, each one above other! Ye have one cursed and wicked tyrant that now reigneth over you, without any right or title, oppressing you with his most bloody cruelty. This other that hath the right to the crown, is so replete with the inconstant behavior and manifest vices of Englishmen, that he is nothing worthy to enjoy it: for by his own confession he is not only avaricious, and given to unsatiable lust, but so false a traitor withal, that no trust is to be had unto any word he speaketh. Adieu Scotland, for now I account my self a banished man for ever, without comfort or consolation,&rsquo; and with those words the brackish tears trickled down his cheeks very abundantly.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;At the last, when he was ready to depart, Malcolme took him by the sleeve, and said: &lsquo;Be of good comfort Makduffe, for I have none of these vices before remembered, but have jested with thee in this manner, onely to prove thy mind: for diverse times heretofore hath Makbeth sought by this manner of means to bring me into his hands, but the more slow I have showed my self to condescend to thy motion and request, the more diligence shall I use in accomplishing the same.&rsquo; Incontinently hereupon they embraced each other, and promising to be faithful the one to the other, they fell in consultation how they might best provide for all their business, to bring the same to good effect.&rdquo;<br /><h4>How did &ldquo;Holinshed&rsquo;s Chronicle&rdquo; describe the invasion of England by Malcolm?</h4>While Makduffe secretly wrote from the border to the dissatisfied thanes and assembled an army against Makbeth, Malcolme &ldquo;purchased such favor at king Edward&rsquo;s hands, that old Siward earl of Northumberland was appointed with ten thousand men to go with him into Scotland, to support him in this enterprise, for recovery of his right. After these newes were spread abroad in Scotland, the nobles drew into two several factions, the one taking part with Makbeth, and the other with Malcolme. Hereupon ensued oftentimes sundry bickerings, &amp; diverse light skirmishes: for those that were of Malcolme&rsquo;s side, would not jeopard to join with their enemies in a &lsquo;pight field&rsquo; [pitched battle] till his coming out of England to their support. But after that Makbeth perceived his enemies power to increase, by such aid as came to them forth of England with his adversary Malcolme, he recoiled back into Fife, there purposing to abide in camp fortified, at the Castle of Dunsinane, and to fight with his enemies, if they meant to pursue him.&rdquo;<br /><br />Though Makbeth&rsquo;s friends cannily advised him &ldquo;either to make some agreement with Malcolme, or else to flee with all speed into the Isles, and to take his treasure with him, to the end he might &lsquo;wage&rsquo; [bribe] sundry great princes of the realm to take his part, and retain strangers, in whom he might better trust than in his own subjects, which stale daily from him, [...] he had such confidence in his prophesies, that he believed he should never be vanquished, till Birnane wood were brought to Dunsinane; nor yet to be slain with any man, that should be or was borne of any woman.&rdquo;<br /><br />Malcolme chased Makbeth into Dunsinane, and &ldquo;came the night before the battle unto Birnane wood. [...] When his army had rested a while there to refresh them, he commanded every man to get a bough of some tree or other of that wood in his hand, as big as he might bear, and to march forth therewith in such wise, that on the next morrow they might come closely and without sight in this manner within view of his enemies. On the morrow when Makbeth beheld them coming in this sort, he first marveled what the matter meant, but in the end remembered himself that the prophesy which he had heard long before that time [...] was likely to be now fulfilled. Nevertheless, he brought his men in order of battle, and exhorted them to do valiantly, howbeit his enemies had scarcely cast from them their boughs, when Makbeth perceiving their numbers, betook him streight to flight.&rdquo;<br /><h4>How did &ldquo;Holinshed&rsquo;s Chronicle&rdquo; describe Macbeth&rsquo;s death?</h4>Makduffe pursued him &ldquo;with great hatred even till he came unto Lunfannaine, where Makbeth perceiving that Makduffe was hard at his back, leapt beside his horse, saying; &lsquo;Thou traitor, what meaneth it that thou shouldest thus in vain follow me that am no appointed to be slain by any creature that is borne of woman, come on therefore, and receive thy reward which thou hast deserved for thy pains,&rsquo; and therewithal he lifted up his sword thinking to have slain him. But Makduffe quickly avoiding from his horse, ere he came at him, answered (with his naked sword in his hand) saying: "It is true Makbeth, and now shall thine insatiable cruelty have an end, for I am even he that thy wizards have told thee of, who was never born of my mother, but ripped out of her womb" therewithal he stepped unto him, and slew him in the place. Then cutting his head from his shoulders, he set it upon a pole, and brought it unto Malcolme&rdquo;<br /><br />The chronicle&rsquo;s epitaph for the tyrant completes the section: &ldquo;This was the end of Makbeth, after he had reigned 17 years over the Scottishmen. In the beginning of his reign he accomplished many worthy acts, very profitable to the common-wealth [...] but afterward by illusion of the devil, he defamed the same with most terrible cruelty. He was slain in the year of the incarnation, 1057, and in the 16 year of king Edward&rsquo;s reign over the Englishmen.&rdquo; Malcolme rewarded the thanes that had supported him and &ldquo;created many earls, lords, barons, and knights. Many of them that before were thanes, were at this time made earls, as Fife, Menteth, Atholl, Leuenox, Murrey, Cathnes, Rosse, and Angus. These were the first earls that have been heard of amongst the Scottishmen (as their histories do make mention.)&rdquo;<br /><h4>How did Shakespeare adapt the material in &ldquo;Holinshed&rsquo;s Chronicle&rdquo;?</h4>&ldquo;Holinshed&rsquo;s Chronicle&rdquo; provided Shakespeare with his characters, the plot, several specific scenes and even part of the dialogue. The playwright took Malcolm&rsquo;s test of Macduff&rsquo;s loyalty, the most elaborate scene in the chronicle, directly from his source and merely dramatized the dialogue provided by the historians. But he also provided the play with a much more straightforward structure that he superimposed over the historical facts.<br /><br />Macbeth&rsquo;s successful decade as a king and Duncan&rsquo;s shortcomings (Duncan is much more like Shakespeare's disastrous Henry VI in the chronicle) were completely omitted in favor of a greater contrast between Duncan&rsquo;s saintliness (perhaps borrowed from Edward the Confessor&rsquo;s) and Macbeth&rsquo;s satanic ambition and descent into anarchy. Shakespeare collapsed the three &ldquo;weird sisters&rdquo; mentioned by the chronicle with the later wizards and witches consulted by Macbeth during his decadence. Banquo is a much less likable character in the chronicle, though part of the reason for this could be that the book was published in England before 1603, when English publishers would not have been too worried about slightly tarnishing the reputation of king James&rsquo;s ancestor. By the time Shakespeare wrote his play, however, he did away with any mention of Banquo&rsquo;s complicity in Duncan&rsquo;s murder, or his own eagerness about the prophecies.<br /><br />The most striking departure from the chronicle (besides the extreme time compression to suppress Macbeth&rsquo;s successful decade) is Shakespeare&rsquo;s expansion of a single line (&ldquo;the words of the three weird sisters also [...] greatly encouraged him hereunto, but especially his wife lay sore upon him to attempt the thing, as she that was very ambitious, burning in unquenchable desire to bear the name of a queen&rdquo;) into the crucial character of Lady Macbeth.<br /><h4>Did Shakespeare use other works in his portrayal of the witches?</h4>As for the &ldquo;weird sisters,&rdquo; Shakespeare had enough to sketch them from the chronicle and from common-knowledge &ldquo;winter tales&rdquo; about such characters, but scholars have conjectured a familiarity with contemporary texts about witchcraft, particularly king James&rsquo;s &ldquo;Daemonologie&rdquo; treatise and Reginald Scot&rsquo;s skeptical <a target="_blank" href="http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/scot16.htm">&ldquo;The Discoverie of Witchcraft&rdquo;</a> (1584).<br /><br />Shakespeare uses in passing the unusual word "auger-hole&rdquo; (a hole made by carpenters with a tool called an auger) and this mention has suggested to some scholars that the playwright was very familiar with Scot's &ldquo;Discoverie.&rdquo; Scot's book was extremely controversial at the time because it insisted that what was thought by the majority to be witchcraft was really a combination of folk medicine and stage magic, and the witch-hunters were mostly prosecuting mentally ill or ignorant poor old women. Scot's book was banned in England and many copies were burnt after 1603 because king James though it went against his own views on the matter.<br /><br />The connection with Macbeth is fairly tenuous: Scot mentions among the supposed abilities of witches that they were able to go "in and out of awger-holes." Since the word is quite rare, those who want to believe that Shakespeare read Scot insist that he must have gotten that word from The Discoverie. This theory owes much to wishful thinking: some modern scholars would really like Shakespeare to share their skepticism and empathy for the victims of witchhunts, rather than the official view at the time.<br /><br /><h4>Additional Reading</h4><br />- <a href="http://www.folger.edu/template.cfm?cid=919" target="_blank">Folger Library site for Macbeth</a> <br />- <a href="http://dewey.library.upenn.edu/sceti/printedbooksNew/index.cfm?TextID=firstfolio&amp;PagePosition=738" target="_blank">Facsimile of the First Folio</a> <br />- Amanda Mabillard, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.shakespeare-online.com/sources/macbethsources.html">&ldquo;An Analysis of Shakespeare's Sources for Macbeth,&rdquo;</a> Shakespeare Online. 2000.
