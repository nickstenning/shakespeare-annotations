The COUNT's palace.</h3><blockquote><i>Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black</i></blockquote><a><b>COUNTESS</b></a><blockquote><a>In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BERTRAM</b></a><blockquote><a>And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death</a><br /><a>anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to</a><br /><a>whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LAFEU</b></a><blockquote><a>You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,</a><br /><a>sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times</a><br /><a>good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose</a><br /><a>worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather</a><br /><a>than lack it where there is such abundance.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>COUNTESS</b></a><blockquote><a>What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LAFEU</b></a><blockquote><a>He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose</a><br /><a>practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and</a><br /><a>finds no other advantage in the process but only the</a><br /><a>losing of hope by time.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>COUNTESS</b></a><blockquote><a>This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that</a><br /><a>'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was</a><br /><a>almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so</a><br /><a>far, would have made nature immortal, and death</a><br /><a>should have play for lack of work. Would, for the</a><br /><a>king's sake, he were living! I think it would be</a><br /><a>the death of the king's disease.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LAFEU</b></a><blockquote><a>How called you the man you speak of, madam?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>COUNTESS</b></a><blockquote><a>He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was</a><br /><a>his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LAFEU</b></a><blockquote><a>He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very</a><br /><a>lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he</a><br /><a>was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge</a><br /><a>could be set up against mortality.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BERTRAM</b></a><blockquote><a>What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LAFEU</b></a><blockquote><a>A fistula, my lord.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BERTRAM</b></a><blockquote><a>I heard not of it before.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LAFEU</b></a><blockquote><a>I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman</a><br /><a>the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>COUNTESS</b></a><blockquote><a>His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my</a><br /><a>overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that</a><br /><a>her education promises; her dispositions she</a><br /><a>inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where</a><br /><a>an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there</a><br /><a>commendations go with pity; they are virtues and</a><br /><a>traitors too; in her they are the better for their</a><br /><a>simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LAFEU</b></a><blockquote><a>Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>COUNTESS</b></a><blockquote><a>'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise</a><br /><a>in. The remembrance of her father never approaches</a><br /><a>her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all</a><br /><a>livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;</a><br /><a>go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect</a><br /><a>a sorrow than have it.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>HELENA</b></a><blockquote><a>I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LAFEU</b></a><blockquote><a>Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,</a><br /><a>excessive grief the enemy to the living.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>COUNTESS</b></a><blockquote><a>If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess</a><br /><a>makes it soon mortal.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>BERTRAM</b></a><blockquote><a>Madam, I desire your holy wishes.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LAFEU</b></a><blockquote><a>How understand we that?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>COUNTESS</b></a><blockquote><a>Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father</a><br /><a>In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue</a><br /><a>Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness</a><br /><a>Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,</a><br /><a>Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy</a><br /><a>Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend</a><br /><a>Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,</a><br /><a>But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,</a><br /><a>That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,</a><br /><a>Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;</a><br /><a>'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,</a><br /><a>Advise him.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LAFEU</b></a><blockquote><a>          He cannot want the best</a><br /><a>That shall attend his love.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>COUNTESS</b></a><blockquote><a>Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.</a><br /><p><i>Exit</i></p></blockquote><a><b>BERTRAM</b></a><blockquote><a>[To HELENA]  The best wishes that can be forged in</a><br /><a>your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable</a><br /><a>to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LAFEU</b></a><blockquote><a>Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of</a><br /><a>your father.</a><br /><p><i>Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU</i></p></blockquote><a><b>HELENA</b></a><blockquote><a>O, were that all! I think not on my father;</a><br /><a>And these great tears grace his remembrance more</a><br /><a>Than those I shed for him. What was he like?</a><br /><a>I have forgot him: my imagination</a><br /><a>Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.</a><br /><a>I am undone: there is no living, none,</a><br /><a>If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one</a><br /><a>That I should love a bright particular star</a><br /><a>And think to wed it, he is so above me:</a><br /><a>In his bright radiance and collateral light</a><br /><a>Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.</a><br /><a>The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:</a><br /><a>The hind that would be mated by the lion</a><br /><a>Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,</a><br /><a>To see him every hour; to sit and draw</a><br /><a>His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,</a><br /><a>In our heart's table; heart too capable</a><br /><a>Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:</a><br /><a>But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy</a><br /><a>Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?</a><br /><p><i>Enter PAROLLES</i></p><p><i>Aside</i></p><a>One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;</a><br /><a>And yet I know him a notorious liar,</a><br /><a>Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;</a><br /><a>Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,</a><br /><a>That they take place, when virtue's steely bones</a><br /><a>Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see</a><br /><a>Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>PAROLLES</b></a><blockquote><a>Save you, fair queen!</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>HELENA</b></a><blockquote><a>And you, monarch!</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>PAROLLES</b></a><blockquote><a>No.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>HELENA</b></a><blockquote><a>And no.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>PAROLLES</b></a><blockquote><a>Are you meditating on virginity?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>HELENA</b></a><blockquote><a>Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me</a><br /><a>ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how</a><br /><a>may we barricado it against him?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>PAROLLES</b></a><blockquote><a>Keep him out.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>HELENA</b></a><blockquote><a>But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,</a><br /><a>in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some</a><br /><a>warlike resistance.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>PAROLLES</b></a><blockquote><a>There is none: man, sitting down before you, will</a><br /><a>undermine you and blow you up.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>HELENA</b></a><blockquote><a>Bless our poor virginity from underminers and</a><br /><a>blowers up! Is there no military policy, how</a><br /><a>virgins might blow up men?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>PAROLLES</b></a><blockquote><a>Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be</a><br /><a>blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with</a><br /><a>the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It</a><br /><a>is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to</a><br /><a>preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational</a><br /><a>increase and there was never virgin got till</a><br /><a>virginity was first lost. That you were made of is</a><br /><a>metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost</a><br /><a>may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is</a><br /><a>ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>HELENA</b></a><blockquote><a>I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>PAROLLES</b></a><blockquote><a>There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the</a><br /><a>rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,</a><br /><a>is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible</a><br /><a>disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:</a><br /><a>virginity murders itself and should be buried in</a><br /><a>highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate</a><br /><a>offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,</a><br /><a>much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very</a><br /><a>paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.</a><br /><a>Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of</a><br /><a>self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the</a><br /><a>canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose</a><br /><a>by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make</a><br /><a>itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the</a><br /><a>principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>HELENA</b></a><blockquote><a>How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>PAROLLES</b></a><blockquote><a>Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it</a><br /><a>likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with</a><br /><a>lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't</a><br /><a>while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.</a><br /><a>Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out</a><br /><a>of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just</a><br /><a>like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not</a><br /><a>now. Your date is better in your pie and your</a><br /><a>porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,</a><br /><a>your old virginity, is like one of our French</a><br /><a>withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,</a><br /><a>'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;</a><br /><a>marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>HELENA</b></a><blockquote><a>Not my virginity yet [         ]</a><br /><a>There shall your master have a thousand loves,</a><br /><a>A mother and a mistress and a friend,</a><br /><a>A phoenix, captain and an enemy,</a><br /><a>A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,</a><br /><a>A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;</a><br /><a>His humble ambition, proud humility,</a><br /><a>His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,</a><br /><a>His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world</a><br /><a>Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,</a><br /><a>That blinking Cupid gossips.

'Tis pity--</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>PAROLLES</b></a><blockquote><a>What's pity?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>HELENA</b></a><blockquote><a>That wishing well had not a body in't,</a><br /><a>Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,</a><br /><a>Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,</a><br /><a>Might with effects of them follow our friends,</a><br /><a>And show what we alone must think, which never</a><br /><a>Return us thanks.</a><br /><p><i>Enter Page</i></p></blockquote><a><b>Page</b></a><blockquote><a>Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.</a><br /><p><i>Exit</i></p></blockquote><a><b>PAROLLES</b></a><blockquote><a>Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I</a><br /><a>will think of thee at court.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>HELENA</b></a><blockquote><a>Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>PAROLLES</b></a><blockquote><a>Under Mars, I.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>HELENA</b></a><blockquote><a>I especially think, under Mars.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>PAROLLES</b></a><blockquote><a>Why under Mars?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>HELENA</b></a><blockquote><a>The wars have so kept you under that you must needs</a><br /><a>be born under Mars.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>PAROLLES</b></a><blockquote><a>When he was predominant.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>HELENA</b></a><blockquote><a>When he was retrograde, I think, rather.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>PAROLLES</b></a><blockquote><a>Why think you so?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>HELENA</b></a><blockquote><a>You go so much backward when you fight.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>PAROLLES</b></a><blockquote><a>That's for advantage.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>HELENA</b></a><blockquote><a>So is running away, when fear proposes the safety;</a><br /><a>but the composition that your valour and fear makes</a><br /><a>in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>PAROLLES</b></a><blockquote><a>I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee</a><br /><a>acutely.
