<span id = 1846 ></span><span id = 1847 >SCENE I. A hall in DUKE SOLINUS'S palace.<br /><br />Enter DUKE SOLINUS, AEGEON, Gaoler, Officers, and other Attendants <br /><br />AEGEON<br /><br />Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall And by the doom of death end woes and all.<br /><br />DUKE SOLINUS<br /><br />Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more; I am not partial to infringe our laws: The enmity and discord which of late Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen, Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods, Excludes all pity from our threatening looks. For, since the mortal and intestine jars 'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us, It hath in solemn synods been decreed Both by the Syracusians and ourselves, To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more, If any born at Ephesus be seen At any Syracusian marts and fairs; Again: if any Syracusian born Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies, His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose, Unless a thousand marks be levied, To quit the penalty and to ransom him. Thy substance, valued at the highest rate, Cannot amount unto a hundred marks; Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.<br /><br />AEGEON<br /><br />Yet this my comfort: when your words are done, My woes end likewise with the evening sun.<br /><br />DUKE SOLINUS<br /><br />Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause Why thou departed'st from thy native home And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.<br /><br />AEGEON<br /><br />A heavier task could not have been imposed Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable: Yet, that the world may witness that my end Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence, I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave. In Syracusa was I born, and wed Unto a woman, happy but for me, And by me, had not our hap been bad. With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased By prosperous voyages I often made To Epidamnum; till my factor's death And the great care of goods at random left Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse: From whom my absence was not six months old Before herself, almost at fainting under The pleasing punishment that women bear, Had made provision for her following me And soon and safe arrived where I was. There had she not been long, but she became A joyful mother of two goodly sons; And, which was strange, the one so like the other, As could not be distinguish'd but by names. That very hour, and in the self-same inn, A meaner woman was delivered Of such a burden, male twins, both alike: Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,-- I bought and brought up to attend my sons. My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys, Made daily motions for our home return: Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon, We came aboard. A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd, Before the always wind-obeying deep Gave any tragic instance of our harm: But longer did we not retain much hope; For what obscured light the heavens did grant Did but convey unto our fearful minds A doubtful warrant of immediate death; Which though myself would gladly have embraced, Yet the incessant weepings of my wife, Weeping before for what she saw must come, And piteous plainings of the pretty babes, That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear, Forced me to seek delays for them and me. And this it was, for other means was none: The sailors sought for safety by our boat, And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us: My wife, more careful for the latter-born, Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast, Such as seafaring men provide for storms; To him one of the other twins was bound, Whilst I had been like heedful of the other: The children thus disposed, my wife and I, Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd, Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast; And floating straight, obedient to the stream, Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought. At length the sun, gazing upon the earth, Dispersed those vapours that offended us; And by the benefit of his wished light, The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered Two ships from far making amain to us, Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this: But ere they came,--O, let me say no more! Gather the sequel by that went before.<br /><br />DUKE SOLINUS<br /><br />Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so; For we may pity, though not pardon thee.<br /><br />AEGEON<br /><br />O, had the gods done so, I had not now Worthily term'd them merciless to us! For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues, We were encounterd by a mighty rock; Which being violently borne upon, Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst; So that, in this unjust divorce of us, Fortune had left to both of us alike What to delight in, what to sorrow for. Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened With lesser weight but not with lesser woe, Was carried with more speed before the wind; And in our sight they three were taken up By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought. At length, another ship had seized on us; And, knowing whom it was their hap to save, Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests; And would have reft the fishers of their prey, Had not their bark been very slow of sail; And therefore homeward did they bend their course. Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss; That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd, To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.<br /><br />DUKE SOLINUS<br /><br />And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for, Do me the favour to dilate at full What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.<br /><br />AEGEON<br /><br />My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care, At eighteen years became inquisitive After his brother: and importuned me That his attendant--so his case was like, Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name-- Might bear him company in the quest of him: Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see, I hazarded the loss of whom I loved. Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece, Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia, And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus; Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought Or that or any place that harbours men. But here must end the story of my life; And happy were I in my timely death, Could all my travels warrant me they live.<br /><br />DUKE SOLINUS<br /><br />Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd To bear the extremity of dire mishap! Now, trust me, were it not against our laws, Against my crown, my oath, my dignity, Which princes, would they, may not disannul, My soul would sue as advocate for thee. But, though thou art adjudged to the death And passed sentence may not be recall'd But to our honour's great disparagement, Yet I will favour thee in what I can. Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day To seek thy life by beneficial help: Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus; Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum, And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die. Gaoler, take him to thy custody.<br /><br />Gaoler<br /><br />I will, my lord.<br /><br />AEGEON<br /><br />Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend, But to procrastinate his lifeless end.<br /><br />Exeunt <br /></span><span id = 1848 >SCENE II. The Mart.<br /><br />Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse, DROMIO of Syracuse, and First Merchant <br /><br />First Merchant<br /><br />Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum, Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate. This very day a Syracusian merchant Is apprehended for arrival here; And not being able to buy out his life According to the statute of the town, Dies ere the weary sun set in the west. There is your money that I had to keep. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host, And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee. Within this hour it will be dinner-time: Till that, I'll view the manners of the town, Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings, And then return and sleep within mine inn, For with long travel I am stiff and weary. Get thee away.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Many a man would take you at your word, And go indeed, having so good a mean.<br /><br />Exit ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />A trusty villain, sir, that very oft, When I am dull with care and melancholy, Lightens my humour with his merry jests. What, will you walk with me about the town, And then go to my inn and dine with me?<br /><br />First Merchant<br /><br />I am invited, sir, to certain merchants, Of whom I hope to make much benefit; I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock, Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart And afterward consort you till bed-time: My present business calls me from you now. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Farewell till then: I will go lose myself And wander up and down to view the city.<br /><br />First Merchant<br /><br />Sir, I commend you to your own content.<br /><br />Exit ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />He that commends me to mine own content Commends me to the thing I cannot get. I to the world am like a drop of water That in the ocean seeks another drop, Who, falling there to find his fellow forth, Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself: So I, to find a mother and a brother, In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.<br /><br />Enter DROMIO of Ephesus Here comes the almanac of my true date. What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late: The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit, The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell; My mistress made it one upon my cheek: She is so hot because the meat is cold; The meat is cold because you come not home; You come not home because you have no stomach; You have no stomach having broke your fast; But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray Are penitent for your default to-day. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray: Where have you left the money that I gave you?<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />O,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper? The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />I am not in a sportive humour now: Tell me, and dally not, where is the money? We being strangers here, how darest thou trust So great a charge from thine own custody?<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />I pray you, air, as you sit at dinner: I from my mistress come to you in post; If I return, I shall be post indeed, For she will score your fault upon my pate. Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock, And strike you home without a messenger. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season; Reserve them till a merrier hour than this. Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness, And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />My charge was but to fetch you from the mart Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner: My mistress and her sister stays for you. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />In what safe place you have bestow'd my money, Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours That stands on tricks when I am undisposed: Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />I have some marks of yours upon my pate, Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders, But not a thousand marks between you both. If I should pay your worship those again, Perchance you will not bear them patiently. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Thy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix; She that doth fast till you come home to dinner, And prays that you will hie you home to dinner. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face, Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />What mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands! Nay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.<br /><br />&nbsp;Exit ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Upon my life, by some device or other The villain is o'er-raught of all my money. They say this town is full of cozenage, As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye, Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind, Soul-killing witches that deform the body, Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks, And many such-like liberties of sin: If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner. I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave: I greatly fear my money is not safe.<br /><br />Exit</span><span id = 1849 ></span><span id = 1850 >SCENE I. The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.<br /><br />Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA <br /><br />ADRIANA<br /><br />Neither my husband nor the slave return'd, That in such haste I sent to seek his master! Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.<br /><br />LUCIANA<br /><br />Perhaps some merchant hath invited him, And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner. Good sister, let us dine and never fret: A man is master of his liberty: Time is their master, and, when they see time, They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.<br /><br />ADRIANA<br /><br />Why should their liberty than ours be more?<br /><br />LUCIANA<br /><br />Because their business still lies out o' door.<br /><br />ADRIANA<br /><br />Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.<br /><br />LUCIANA<br /><br />O, know he is the bridle of your will.<br /><br />ADRIANA<br /><br />There's none but asses will be bridled so.<br /><br />LUCIANA<br /><br />Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe. There's nothing situate under heaven's eye But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky: The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls, Are their males' subjects and at their controls: Men, more divine, the masters of all these, Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas, Indued with intellectual sense and souls, Of more preeminence than fish and fowls, Are masters to their females, and their lords: Then let your will attend on their accords.<br /><br />ADRIANA<br /><br />This servitude makes you to keep unwed.<br /><br />LUCIANA<br /><br />Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.<br /><br />ADRIANA<br /><br />But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.<br /><br />LUCIANA<br /><br />Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.<br /><br />ADRIANA<br /><br />How if your husband start some other where?<br /><br />LUCIANA<br /><br />&nbsp;Till he come home again, I would forbear.<br /><br />ADRIANA<br /><br />&nbsp;Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause; They can be meek that have no other cause. A wretched soul, bruised with adversity, We bid be quiet when we hear it cry; But were we burdened with like weight of pain, As much or more would we ourselves complain: So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee, With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me, But, if thou live to see like right bereft, This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.<br /><br />LUCIANA<br /><br />&nbsp;Well, I will marry one day, but to try. Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.<br /><br />&nbsp;Enter DROMIO of Ephesus<br /><br />ADRIANA<br /><br />&nbsp;Say, is your tardy master now at hand?<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />&nbsp;Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears can witness.<br /><br />ADRIANA<br /><br />&nbsp;Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />&nbsp;Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear: Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.<br /><br />LUCIANA<br /><br />&nbsp;Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />&nbsp;Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce understand them.<br /><br />ADRIANA<br /><br />&nbsp;But say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems he hath great care to please his wife.<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />&nbsp;Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.<br /><br />ADRIANA<br /><br />&nbsp;Horn-mad, thou villain!<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />&nbsp;I mean not cuckold-mad; But, sure, he is stark mad. When I desired him to come home to dinner, He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold: 'Tis dinner-time,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he; 'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he: 'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he. 'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?' 'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he: 'My mistress, sir' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress! I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!'<br /><br />LUCIANA<br /><br />&nbsp;Quoth who?<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />&nbsp;Quoth my master: 'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.' So that my errand, due unto my tongue, I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders; For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.<br /><br />ADRIANA<br /><br />&nbsp;Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />&nbsp;Go back again, and be new beaten home? For God's sake, send some other messenger.<br /><br />ADRIANA<br /><br />&nbsp;Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />&nbsp;And he will bless that cross with other beating: Between you I shall have a holy head.<br /><br />ADRIANA<br /><br />&nbsp;Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />&nbsp;Am I so round with you as you with me, That like a football you do spurn me thus? You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither: If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.<br /><br />&nbsp;Exit<br /><br />LUCIANA<br /><br />&nbsp;Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!<br /><br />ADRIANA<br /><br />&nbsp;His company must do his minions grace, Whilst I at home starve for a merry look. Hath homely age the alluring beauty took From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it: Are my discourses dull? barren my wit? If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd, Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard: Do their gay vestments his affections bait? That's not my fault: he's master of my state: What ruins are in me that can be found, By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground Of my defeatures. My decayed fair A sunny look of his would soon repair But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.<br /><br />LUCIANA<br /><br />&nbsp;Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!<br /><br />ADRIANA<br /><br />&nbsp;Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense. I know his eye doth homage otherwhere, Or else what lets it but he would be here? Sister, you know he promised me a chain; Would that alone, alone he would detain, So he would keep fair quarter with his bed! I see the jewel best enamelled Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still, That others touch, and often touching will Wear gold: and no man that hath a name, By falsehood and corruption doth it shame. Since that my beauty cannot please his eye, I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.<br /><br />LUCIANA<br /><br />&nbsp;How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!<br /><br />&nbsp;Exeunt <br /></span><span id = 1851 >SCENE II. A public place.<br /><br />Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse <br /><br />ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave Is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out By computation and mine host's report. I could not speak with Dromio since at first I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.<br /><br />Enter DROMIO of Syracuse How now sir! is your merry humour alter'd? As you love strokes, so jest with me again. You know no Centaur? you received no gold? Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner? My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad, That thus so madly thou didst answer me?<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />What answer, sir? when spake I such a word? ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Even now, even here, not half an hour since.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />I did not see you since you sent me hence, Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt, And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner; For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />I am glad to see you in this merry vein: What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth? Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.<br /><br />Beating him<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest: Upon what bargain do you give it me? ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Because that I familiarly sometimes Do use you for my fool and chat with you, Your sauciness will jest upon my love And make a common of my serious hours. When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport, But creep in crannies when he hides his beams. If you will jest with me, know my aspect, And fashion your demeanor to my looks, Or I will beat this method in your sconce.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering, I had rather have it a head: an you use these blows long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders. But, I pray, sir why am I beaten? ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Dost thou not know?<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Shall I tell you why?<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath a wherefore. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Why, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore-- For urging it the second time to me.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season, When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason? Well, sir, I thank you. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Thank me, sir, for what?<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />In good time, sir; what's that?<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Basting. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Your reason?<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a time for all things.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />I durst have denied that, before you were so choleric. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />By what rule, sir?<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of father Time himself. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Let's hear it.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />There's no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />May he not do it by fine and recovery?<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the lost hair of another man. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is, so plentiful an excrement?<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts; and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />For what reason?<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />For two; and sound ones too. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Nay, not sound, I pray you.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Sure ones, then. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Certain ones then. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Name them.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />The one, to save the money that he spends in trimming; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />You would all this time have proved there is no time for all things.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair lost by nature. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />But your reason was not substantial, why there is no time to recover.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore to the world's end will have bald followers. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion: But, soft! who wafts us yonder?<br /><br />Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA<br /><br />ADRIANA<br /><br />Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown: Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects; I am not Adriana nor thy wife. The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow That never words were music to thine ear, That never object pleasing in thine eye, That never touch well welcome to thy hand, That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste, Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee. How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it, That thou art thus estranged from thyself? Thyself I call it, being strange to me, That, undividable, incorporate, Am better than thy dear self's better part. Ah, do not tear away thyself from me! For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall A drop of water in the breaking gulf, And take unmingled that same drop again, Without addition or diminishing, As take from me thyself and not me too. How dearly would it touch me to the quick, Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious And that this body, consecrate to thee, By ruffian lust should be contaminate! Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me And hurl the name of husband in my face And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring And break it with a deep-divorcing vow? I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it. I am possess'd with an adulterate blot; My blood is mingled with the crime of lust: For if we too be one and thou play false, I do digest the poison of thy flesh, Being strumpeted by thy contagion. Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed; I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not: In Ephesus I am but two hours old, As strange unto your town as to your talk; Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd, Want wit in all one word to understand.<br /><br />LUCIANA<br /><br />Fie, brother! how the world is changed with you! When were you wont to use my sister thus? She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />By Dromio?<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />By me?<br /><br />ADRIANA<br /><br />By thee; and this thou didst return from him, That he did buffet thee, and, in his blows, Denied my house for his, me for his wife. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman? What is the course and drift of your compact?<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />I, sir? I never saw her till this time. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Villain, thou liest; for even her very words Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />I never spake with her in all my life. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />How can she thus then call us by our names, Unless it be by inspiration.<br /><br />ADRIANA<br /><br />How ill agrees it with your gravity To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave, Abetting him to thwart me in my mood! Be it my wrong you are from me exempt, But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt. Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine: Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine, Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state, Makes me with thy strength to communicate: If aught possess thee from me, it is dross, Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss; Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme: What, was I married to her in my dream? Or sleep I now and think I hear all this? What error drives our eyes and ears amiss? Until I know this sure uncertainty, I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.<br /><br />LUCIANA<br /><br />Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner. This is the fairy land: O spite of spites! We talk with goblins, owls and sprites: If we obey them not, this will ensue, They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.<br /><br />LUCIANA<br /><br />Why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not? Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />I am transformed, master, am I not? ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />I think thou art in mind, and so am I.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Thou hast thine own form.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />No, I am an ape.<br /><br />LUCIANA<br /><br />If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />'Tis true; she rides me and I long for grass. 'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be But I should know her as well as she knows me.<br /><br />ADRIANA<br /><br />Come, come, no longer will I be a fool, To put the finger in the eye and weep, Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn. Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate. Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks. Sirrah, if any ask you for your master, Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter. Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell? Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised? Known unto these, and to myself disguised! I'll say as they say and persever so, And in this mist at all adventures go.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />Master, shall I be porter at the gate?<br /><br />ADRIANA<br /><br />Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.<br /><br />LUCIANA<br /><br />Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.<br /><br />&nbsp;Exeunt</span><span id = 1852 ></span><span id = 1854 >SCENE I. Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.<br /><br />Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus, DROMIO of Ephesus, ANGELO, and BALTHAZAR <br /><br />ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF EPHESUS<br /><br />Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all; My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours: Say that I linger'd with you at your shop To see the making of her carcanet, And that to-morrow you will bring it home. But here's a villain that would face me down He met me on the mart, and that I beat him, And charged him with a thousand marks in gold, And that I did deny my wife and house. Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know; That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show: If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink, Your own handwriting would tell you what I think. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF EPHESUS<br /><br />I think thou art an ass.<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />Marry, so it doth appear By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear. I should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass, You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF EPHESUS<br /><br />You're sad, Signior Balthazar: pray God our cheer May answer my good will and your good welcome here.<br /><br />BALTHAZAR<br /><br />I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome dear. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF EPHESUS<br /><br />O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish, A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.<br /><br />BALTHAZAR<br /><br />Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF EPHESUS<br /><br />And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.<br /><br />BALTHAZAR<br /><br />Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF EPHESUS<br /><br />Ay, to a niggardly host, and more sparing guest: But though my cates be mean, take them in good part; Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart. But, soft! my door is lock'd. Go bid them let us in.<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicel, Gillian, Ginn!<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />[Within] Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb, idiot, patch! Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch. Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st for such store, When one is one too many? Go, get thee from the door.<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />What patch is made our porter? My master stays in the street.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />[Within] Let him walk from whence he came, lest he catch cold on's feet. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF EPHESUS<br /><br />Who talks within there? ho, open the door!<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />[Within] Right, sir; I'll tell you when, an you tell me wherefore. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF EPHESUS<br /><br />Wherefore? for my dinner: I have not dined to-day.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />[Within] Nor to-day here you must not; come again when you may. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF EPHESUS<br /><br />What art thou that keepest me out from the house I owe?<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />[Within] The porter for this time, sir, and my name is Dromio.<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />O villain! thou hast stolen both mine office and my name. The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame. If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place, Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thy name for an ass.<br /><br />LUCE<br /><br />[Within] What a coil is there, Dromio? who are those at the gate?<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />Let my master in, Luce.<br /><br />LUCE<br /><br />[Within] Faith, no; he comes too late; And so tell your master.<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />O Lord, I must laugh! Have at you with a proverb--Shall I set in my staff?<br /><br />LUCE<br /><br />[Within] Have at you with another; that's--When? can you tell?<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />[Within] If thy name be call'd Luce--Luce, thou hast answered him well.<br /><br />ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />Do you hear, you minion? you'll let us in, I hope? OF EPHESUS<br /><br />LUCE<br /><br />[Within] I thought to have asked you.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />[Within] And you said no.<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />So, come, help: well struck! there was blow for blow. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF EPHESUS<br /><br />Thou baggage, let me in.<br /><br />LUCE<br /><br />[Within] Can you tell for whose sake?<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />Master, knock the door hard.<br /><br />LUCE<br /><br />[Within] Let him knock till it ache. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF EPHESUS<br /><br />You'll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.<br /><br />LUCE<br /><br />[Within] What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?<br /><br />ADRIANA<br /><br />[Within] Who is that at the door that keeps all this noise?<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />[Within] By my troth, your town is troubled with unruly boys. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF EPHESUS<br /><br />Are you there, wife? you might have come before.<br /><br />ADRIANA<br /><br />[Within] Your wife, sir knave! go get you from the door.<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />If you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.<br /><br />ANGELO<br /><br />Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would fain have either.<br /><br />BALTHAZAR<br /><br />In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF EPHESUS<br /><br />There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />You would say so, master, if your garments were thin. Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold: It would make a man mad as a buck, to be so bought and sold. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF EPHESUS<br /><br />Go fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />[Within] Break any breaking here, and I'll break your knave's pate.<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind, Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />[Within] It seems thou want'st breaking: out upon thee, hind!<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />Here's too much 'out upon thee!' I pray thee, let me in.<br /><br />DROMIO OF SYRACUSE<br /><br />[Within] Ay, when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF EPHESUS<br /><br />Well, I'll break in: go borrow me a crow.<br /><br />DROMIO OF EPHESUS<br /><br />A crow without feather? Master, mean you so? For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather; If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF EPHESUS<br /><br />Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.<br /><br />BALTHAZAR<br /><br />Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so! Herein you war against your reputation And draw within the compass of suspect The unviolated honour of your wife. Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom, Her sober virtue, years and modesty, Plead on her part some cause to you unknown: And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse Why at this time the doors are made against you. Be ruled by me: depart in patience, And let us to the Tiger all to dinner, And about evening come yourself alone To know the reason of this strange restraint. If by strong hand you offer to break in Now in the stirring passage of the day, A vulgar comment will be made of it, And that supposed by the common rout Against your yet ungalled estimation That may with foul intrusion enter in And dwell upon your grave when you are dead; For slander lives upon succession, For ever housed where it gets possession. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF EPHESUS<br /><br />You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet, And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry. I know a wench of excellent discourse, Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle: There will we dine. This woman that I mean, My wife--but, I protest, without desert-- Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal: To her will we to dinner.<br /><br />To Angelo Get you home And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made: Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine; For there's the house: that chain will I bestow-- Be it for nothing but to spite my wife-- Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste. Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me, I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.<br /><br />ANGELO<br /><br />I'll meet you at that place some hour hence. ANTIPHOLUS<br /><br />OF EPHESUS<br /><br />Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.<br /><br />Exeunt <br /></span><span id = 2042 ><p>SCENE II.
