King Lear's palace.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter KENT, GLOUCESTER, and EDMUND <br /><br />KENT<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought the king had more affected the Duke of<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Albany than Cornwall.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It did always seem so to us: but now, in the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; division of the kingdom, it appears not which of<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the dukes he values most; for equalities are so<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of either's moiety.<br /><br />KENT<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is not this your son, my lord?<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brazed to it.<br /><br />KENT<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot conceive you.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you smell a fault?<br /><br />KENT<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; being so proper.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; though this knave came something saucily into the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; world before he was sent for, yet was his mother<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fair; there was good sport at his making, and the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; noble gentleman, Edmund?<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, my lord.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; honourable friend.<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My services to your lordship.<br /><br />KENT<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must love you, and sue to know you better.<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I shall study deserving.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hath been out nine years, and away he shall<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; again. The king is coming.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sennet. Enter KING LEAR, CORNWALL, ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, CORDELIA, and Attendants<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall, my liege.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EDMUND<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me the map there. Know that we have divided<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To shake all cares and business from our age;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conferring them on younger strengths, while we<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you, our no less loving son of Albany,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have this hour a constant will to publish<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since now we will divest us both of rule,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interest of territory, cares of state,--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which of you shall we say doth love us most?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That we our largest bounty may extend<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our eldest-born, speak first.<br /><br />GONERIL<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As much as child e'er loved, or father found;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond all manner of so much I love you.<br /><br />CORDELIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Aside] What shall Cordelia do?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love, and be silent.<br /><br />LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.<br /><br />REGAN<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am made<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the self-same metal that my sister is,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And prize me at her worth. In my true heart<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find she names my very deed of love;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only she comes too short: that I profess<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Myself an enemy to all other joys,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which the most precious square of sense possesses;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And find I am alone felicitate<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In your dear highness' love.<br /><br />CORDELIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Aside] Then poor Cordelia!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More richer than my tongue.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To thee and thine hereditary ever<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No less in space, validity, and pleasure,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the last, not least; to whose young love<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vines of France and milk of Burgundy<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.<br /><br />CORDELIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing, my lord.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing!<br /><br />CORDELIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.<br /><br />CORDELIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to my bond; nor more nor less.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest it may mar your fortunes.<br /><br />CORDELIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good my lord,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Return those duties back as are right fit,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obey you, love you, and most honour you.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why have my sisters husbands, if they say<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half my love with him, half my care and duty:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To love my father all.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But goes thy heart with this?<br /><br />CORDELIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ay, good my lord.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So young, and so untender?<br /><br />CORDELIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So young, my lord, and true.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let it be so; thy truth, then, be thy dower:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By all the operation of the orbs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From whom we do exist, and cease to be;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here I disclaim all my paternal care,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Propinquity and property of blood,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as a stranger to my heart and me<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hold thee, from this, for ever. The barbarous Scythian,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or he that makes his generation messes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and relieved,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As thou my sometime daughter.<br /><br />KENT<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good my liege,--<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peace, Kent!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come not between the dragon and his wrath.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I loved her most, and thought to set my rest<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So be my grave my peace, as here I give<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her father's heart from her! Call France; who stirs?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With my two daughters' dowers digest this third:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do invest you jointly with my power,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pre-eminence, and all the large effects<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With reservation of an hundred knights,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The name, and all the additions to a king;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This coronet part betwixt you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Giving the crown<br /><br />KENT<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Royal Lear,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loved as my father, as my master follow'd,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As my great patron thought on in my prayers,--<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft.<br /><br />KENT<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let it fall rather, though the fork invade<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Lear is mad. What wilt thou do, old man?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When majesty stoops to folly. Reverse thy doom;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, in thy best consideration, cheque<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reverbs no hollowness.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kent, on thy life, no more.<br /><br />KENT<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My life I never held but as a pawn<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To wage against thy enemies; nor fear to lose it,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy safety being the motive.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of my sight!<br /><br />KENT<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See better, Lear; and let me still remain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The true blank of thine eye.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, by Apollo,--<br /><br />KENT<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, by Apollo, king,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O, vassal! miscreant!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laying his hand on his sword<br /><br />ALBANY CORNWALL<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear sir, forbear.<br /><br />KENT<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon thy foul disease. Revoke thy doom;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll tell thee thou dost evil.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear me, recreant!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On thine allegiance, hear me!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which we durst never yet, and with strain'd pride<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To come between our sentence and our power,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our potency made good, take thy reward.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five days we do allot thee, for provision<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To shield thee from diseases of the world;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on the sixth to turn thy hated back<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This shall not be revoked.<br /><br />KENT<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fare thee well, king: sith thus thou wilt appear,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To CORDELIA<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That justly think'st, and hast most rightly said!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To REGAN and GONERIL<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And your large speeches may your deeds approve,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That good effects may spring from words of love.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He'll shape his old course in a country new.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flourish. Re-enter GLOUCESTER, with KING OF FRANCE, BURGUNDY, and Attendants<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My lord of Burgundy.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We first address towards you, who with this king<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath rivall'd for our daughter: what, in the least,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you require in present dower with her,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or cease your quest of love?<br /><br />BURGUNDY<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most royal majesty,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I crave no more than what your highness offer'd,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor will you tender less.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right noble Burgundy,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If aught within that little seeming substance,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's there, and she is yours.<br /><br />BURGUNDY<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know no answer.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you, with those infirmities she owes,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take her, or leave her?<br /><br />BURGUNDY<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pardon me, royal sir;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Election makes not up on such conditions.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tell you all her wealth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To KING OF FRANCE<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For you, great king,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would not from your love make such a stray,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To avert your liking a more worthier way<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost to acknowledge hers.<br /><br />KING OF FRANCE<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is most strange,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That she, that even but now was your best object,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The argument of your praise, balm of your age,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must be of such unnatural degree,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fall'n into taint: which to believe of her,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must be a faith that reason without miracle<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could never plant in me.<br /><br />CORDELIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I yet beseech your majesty,--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If for I want that glib and oily art,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll do't before I speak,--that you make known<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That hath deprived me of your grace and favour;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But even for want of that for which I am richer,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I am glad I have not, though not to have it<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath lost me in your liking.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Better thou<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.<br /><br />KING OF FRANCE<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it but this,--a tardiness in nature<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which often leaves the history unspoke<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What say you to the lady? Love's not love<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it is mingled with regards that stand<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is herself a dowry.<br /><br />BURGUNDY<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Royal Lear,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give but that portion which yourself proposed,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And here I take Cordelia by the hand,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Duchess of Burgundy.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.<br /><br />BURGUNDY<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That you must lose a husband.<br /><br />CORDELIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peace be with Burgundy!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since that respects of fortune are his love,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall not be his wife.<br /><br />KING OF FRANCE<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My love should kindle to inflamed respect.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou losest here, a better where to find.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That face of hers again. Therefore be gone<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without our grace, our love, our benison.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, noble Burgundy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flourish. Exeunt all but KING OF FRANCE, GONERIL, REGAN, and CORDELIA<br /><br />KING OF FRANCE<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bid farewell to your sisters.<br /><br />CORDELIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And like a sister am most loath to call<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your faults as they are named. Use well our father:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To your professed bosoms I commit him<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would prefer him to a better place.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, farewell to you both.<br /><br />REGAN<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prescribe not us our duties.<br /><br />GONERIL<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let your study<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be to content your lord, who hath received you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And well are worth the want that you have wanted.<br /><br />CORDELIA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well may you prosper!<br /><br />KING OF FRANCE<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, my fair Cordelia.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exeunt KING OF FRANCE and CORDELIA<br /><br />GONERIL<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sister, it is not a little I have to say of what<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; most nearly appertains to us both. I think our<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; father will hence to-night.<br /><br />REGAN<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.<br /><br />GONERIL<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You see how full of changes his age is; the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; observation we have made of it hath not been<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; little: he always loved our sister most; and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appears too grossly.<br /><br />REGAN<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but slenderly known himself.<br /><br />GONERIL<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best and soundest of his time hath been but<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rash; then must we look to receive from his age,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that infirm and choleric years bring with them.<br /><br />REGAN<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such unconstant starts are we like to have from<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him as this of Kent's banishment.<br /><br />GONERIL<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is further compliment of leavetaking<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; between France and him. Pray you, let's hit<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; together: if our father carry authority with<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; such dispositions as he bears, this last<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; surrender of his will but offend us.<br /><br />REGAN<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall further think on't.<br /><br />GONERIL<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must do something, and i' the heat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exeunt<br /></span><span id = 401 ><br /><br />SCENE II.

Wherefore should I<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stand in the plague of custom, and permit<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The curiosity of nations to deprive me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For that I am some twelve or fourteen moon-shines<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When my dimensions are as well compact,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mind as generous, and my shape as true,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As honest madam's issue?

Edmund, how now! what news?<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So please your lordship, none.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Putting up the letter<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know no news, my lord.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What paper were you reading?<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing, my lord.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No? What needed, then, that terrible dispatch of<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it into your pocket? the quality of nothing hath<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not such need to hide itself. Let's see: come,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I beseech you, sir, pardon me: it is a letter<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from my brother, that I have not all o'er-read;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and for so much as I have perused, I find it not<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fit for your o'er-looking.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me the letter, sir.<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's see, let's see.<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Reads] 'This policy and reverence of age makes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways, not<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me, that of this I may speak more. If our father<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would sleep till I waked him, you should half his<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brother, EDGAR.'<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hum--conspiracy!--'Sleep till I waked him,--you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should enjoy half his revenue,'--My son Edgar!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had he a hand to write this? a heart and brain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to breed it in?--When came this to you? who<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brought it?<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not brought me, my lord; there's the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cunning of it; I found it thrown in at the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; casement of my closet.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know the character to be your brother's?<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it were his; but, in respect of that, I would<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fain think it were not.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is his.<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not in the contents.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business?<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never, my lord: but I have heard him oft<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; maintain it to be fit, that, sons at perfect age,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and fathers declining, the father should be as<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O villain, villain! His very opinion in the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seek him; I'll apprehend him: abominable villain!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is he?<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you to suspend your indignation against my<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brother till you can derive from him better<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; testimony of his intent, you shall run a certain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; course; where, if you violently proceed against<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gap in your own honour, and shake in pieces the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for him, that he hath wrote this to feel my<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; affection to your honour, and to no further<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pretence of danger.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think you so?<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your honour judge it meet, I will place you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where you shall hear us confer of this, and by an<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; auricular assurance have your satisfaction; and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that without any further delay than this very evening.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He cannot be such a monster--<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor is not, sure.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To his father, that so tenderly and entirely<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out: wind me into him, I pray you: frame the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; business after your own wisdom. I would unstate<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myself, to be in a due resolution.<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will seek him, sir, presently: convey the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; business as I shall find means and acquaint you withal.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no good to us: though the wisdom of nature can<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scourged by the sequent effects: love cools,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; friendship falls off, brothers divide: in<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; palaces, treason; and the bond cracked 'twixt son<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and father. This villain of mine comes under the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prediction; there's son against father: the king<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; falls from bias of nature; there's father against<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; child. We have seen the best of our time:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lose thee nothing; do it carefully. And the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; offence, honesty! 'Tis strange.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the excellent foppery of the world, that,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when we are sick in fortune,--often the surfeit<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of our own behavior,--we make guilty of our<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars: as<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if we were villains by necessity; fools by<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; treachers, by spherical predominance; drunkards,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; liars, and adulterers, by an enforced obedience of<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; planetary influence; and all that we are evil in,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by a divine thrusting on: an admirable evasion<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disposition to the charge of a star! My<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; father compounded with my mother under the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dragon's tail; and my nativity was under Ursa<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; major; so that it follows, I am rough and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lecherous. Tut, I should have been that I am,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had the maidenliest star in the firmament<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter EDGAR<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; comedy: my cue is villanous melancholy, with a<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sigh like Tom o' Bedlam. O, these eclipses do<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; portend these divisions! fa, sol, la, mi.<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How now, brother Edmund! what serious<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contemplation are you in?<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this other day, what should follow these eclipses.<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you busy yourself about that?<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unhappily; as of unnaturalness between the child<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the parent; death, dearth, dissolutions of<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; maledictions against king and nobles; needless<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what.<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How long have you been a sectary astronomical?<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, come; when saw you my father last?<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, the night gone by.<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spake you with him?<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ay, two hours together.<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parted you in good terms? Found you no<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; displeasure in him by word or countenance?<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None at all.<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him: and at my entreaty forbear his presence<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; till some little time hath qualified the heat of<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his displeasure; which at this instant so rageth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in him, that with the mischief of your person it<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would scarcely allay.<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some villain hath done me wrong.<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's my fear. I pray you, have a continent<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forbearance till the spied of his rage goes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slower; and, as I say, retire with me to my<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hear my lord speak: pray ye, go; there's my key:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if you do stir abroad, go armed.<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Armed, brother!<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brother, I advise you to the best; go armed: I<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; am no honest man if there be any good meaning<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; towards you: I have told you what I have seen<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and horror of it: pray you, away.<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall I hear from you anon?<br /><br />EDMUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do serve you in this business.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit EDGAR<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A credulous father! and a brother noble,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose nature is so far from doing harms,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That he suspects none: on whose foolish honesty<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My practises ride easy!

Horses are tied<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the heads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the loins, and men by the legs: when a man's<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over-lusty at legs, then he wears wooden<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nether-stocks.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's he that hath so much thy place mistook<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To set thee here?<br /><br />KENT<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is both he and she;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your son and daughter.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No.<br /><br />KENT<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, I say.<br /><br />KENT<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I say, yea.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, no, they would not.<br /><br />KENT<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, they have.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Jupiter, I swear, no.<br /><br />KENT<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Juno, I swear, ay.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They durst not do 't;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They could not, would not do 't; 'tis worse than murder,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To do upon respect such violent outrage:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resolve me, with all modest haste, which way<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou mightst deserve, or they impose, this usage,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coming from us.<br /><br />KENT<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My lord, when at their home<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did commend your highness' letters to them,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere I was risen from the place that show'd<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From Goneril his mistress salutations;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which presently they read: on whose contents,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commanded me to follow, and attend<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And meeting here the other messenger,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose welcome, I perceived, had poison'd mine,--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being the very fellow that of late<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Display'd so saucily against your highness,--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having more man than wit about me, drew:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He raised the house with loud and coward cries.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your son and daughter found this trespass worth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shame which here it suffers.<br /><br />Fool<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winter's not gone yet, if the wild-geese fly that way.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fathers that wear rags<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do make their children blind;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But fathers that bear bags<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall see their children kind.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortune, that arrant whore,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ne'er turns the key to the poor.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy element's below!

They are sick? they are weary?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The images of revolt and flying off.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fetch me a better answer.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My dear lord,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know the fiery quality of the duke;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How unremoveable and fix'd he is<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his own course.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fiery? what quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inform'd them! Dost thou understand me, man?<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ay, my good lord.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The king would speak with Cornwall; the dear father<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would with his daughter speak, commands her service:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fiery? the fiery duke? Tell the hot duke that--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, but not yet: may be he is not well:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Infirmity doth still neglect all office<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereto our health is bound; we are not ourselves<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To suffer with the body: I'll forbear;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And am fall'n out with my more headier will,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To take the indisposed and sickly fit<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the sound man. Death on my state! wherefore<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking on KENT<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should he sit here? This act persuades me<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That this remotion of the duke and her<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is practise only. Give me my servant forth.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go tell the duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or at their chamber-door I'll beat the drum<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till it cry sleep to death.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would have all well betwixt you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O me, my heart, my rising heart! but, down!<br /><br />Fool<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when she put 'em i' the paste alive; she knapped 'em<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o' the coxcombs with a stick, and cried 'Down,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother that, in pure<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kindness to his horse, buttered his hay.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and Servants<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good morrow to you both.<br /><br />CORNWALL<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hail to your grace!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KENT is set at liberty<br /><br />REGAN<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad to see your highness.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regan, I think you are; I know what reason<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sepulchring an adultress.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To KENT<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O, are you free?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some other time for that. Beloved Regan,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy sister's naught: O Regan, she hath tied<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Points to his heart<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can scarce speak to thee; thou'lt not believe<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With how depraved a quality--O Regan!<br /><br />REGAN<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I pray you, sir, take patience: I have hope.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You less know how to value her desert<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than she to scant her duty.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say, how is that?<br /><br />REGAN<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot think my sister in the least<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would fail her obligation: if, sir, perchance<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As clears her from all blame.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My curses on her!<br /><br />REGAN<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O, sir, you are old.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nature in you stands on the very verge<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of her confine: you should be ruled and led<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By some discretion, that discerns your state<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Better than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That to our sister you do make return;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say you have wrong'd her, sir.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask her forgiveness?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you but mark how this becomes the house:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kneeling<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Age is unnecessary: on my knees I beg<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'<br /><br />REGAN<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good sir, no more; these are unsightly tricks:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Return you to my sister.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Rising] Never, Regan:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hath abated me of half my train;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most serpent-like, upon the very heart:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the stored vengeances of heaven fall<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You taking airs, with lameness!<br /><br />CORNWALL<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fie, sir, fie!<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the powerful sun,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To fall and blast her pride!<br /><br />REGAN<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O the blest gods! so will you wish on me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the rash mood is on.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thee o'er to harshness: her eyes are fierce; but thine<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in thee<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in conclusion to oppose the bolt<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against my coming in: thou better know'st<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The offices of nature, bond of childhood,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherein I thee endow'd.<br /><br />REGAN<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good sir, to the purpose.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who put my man i' the stocks?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tucket within<br /><br />CORNWALL<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What trumpet's that?<br /><br />REGAN<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know't, my sister's: this approves her letter,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That she would soon be here.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter OSWALD<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is your lady come?<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a slave, whose easy-borrow'd pride<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out, varlet, from my sight!<br /><br />CORNWALL<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What means your grace?<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou didst not know on't. Who comes here? O heavens,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter GONERIL<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you do love old men, if your sweet sway<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow obedience, if yourselves are old,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make it your cause; send down, and take my part!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To GONERIL<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?<br /><br />GONERIL<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not by the hand, sir? How have I offended?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All's not offence that indiscretion finds<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And dotage terms so.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O sides, you are too tough;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you yet hold? How came my man i' the stocks?<br /><br />CORNWALL<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I set him there, sir: but his own disorders<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deserved much less advancement.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You! did you?<br /><br />REGAN<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If, till the expiration of your month,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will return and sojourn with my sister,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dismissing half your train, come then to me:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am now from home, and out of that provision<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which shall be needful for your entertainment.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To wage against the enmity o' the air;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our youngest born, I could as well be brought<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To knee his throne, and, squire-like; pension beg<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To keep base life afoot. Return with her?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To this detested groom.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pointing at OSWALD<br /><br />GONERIL<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At your choice, sir.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll no more meet, no more see one another:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I and my hundred knights.<br /><br />REGAN<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not altogether so:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those that mingle reason with your passion<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must be content to think you old, and so--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But she knows what she does.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this well spoken?<br /><br />REGAN<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it not well? What should you need of more?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak 'gainst so great a number? How, in one house,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should many people, under two commands,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.<br /><br />GONERIL<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From those that she calls servants or from mine?<br /><br />REGAN<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack you,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We could control them. If you will come to me,--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For now I spy a danger,--I entreat you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To bring but five and twenty: to no more<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will I give place or notice.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave you all--<br /><br />REGAN<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in good time you gave it.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Made you my guardians, my depositaries;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But kept a reservation to be follow'd<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With such a number. What, must I come to you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With five and twenty, Regan? said you so?<br /><br />REGAN<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And speak't again, my lord; no more with me.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When others are more wicked: not being the worst<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stands in some rank of praise.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To GONERIL<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll go with thee:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thou art twice her love.<br /><br />GONERIL<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear me, my lord;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What need you five and twenty, ten, or five,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To follow in a house where twice so many<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have a command to tend you?<br /><br />REGAN<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What need one?<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O, reason not the need: our basest beggars<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are in the poorest thing superfluous:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow not nature more than nature needs,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Man's life's as cheap as beast's: thou art a lady;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If only to go warm were gorgeous,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As full of grief as age; wretched in both!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against their father, fool me not so much<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And let not women's weapons, water-drops,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will have such revenges on you both,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That all the world shall--I will do such things,--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, I'll not weep:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have full cause of weeping; but this heart<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exeunt KING LEAR, GLOUCESTER, KENT, and Fool<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Storm and tempest<br /><br />CORNWALL<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.<br /><br />REGAN<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This house is little: the old man and his people<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cannot be well bestow'd.<br /><br />GONERIL<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And must needs taste his folly.<br /><br />REGAN<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But not one follower.<br /><br />GONERIL<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So am I purposed.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is my lord of Gloucester?<br /><br />CORNWALL<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow'd the old man forth: he is return'd.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Re-enter GLOUCESTER<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The king is in high rage.<br /><br />CORNWALL<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whither is he going?<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He calls to horse; but will I know not whither.<br /><br />CORNWALL<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.<br /><br />GONERIL<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do sorely ruffle; for many miles a bout<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's scarce a bush.<br /><br />REGAN<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O, sir, to wilful men,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The injuries that they themselves procure<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must be their schoolmasters.

Where's the king?<br /><br />Gentleman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contending with the fretful element:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or swell the curled water 'bove the main,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Catch in their fury, and make nothing of;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lion and the belly-pinched wolf<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And bids what will take all.<br /><br />KENT<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But who is with him?<br /><br />Gentleman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None but the fool; who labours to out-jest<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His heart-struck injuries.<br /><br />KENT<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I do know you;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And dare, upon the warrant of my note,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although as yet the face of it be cover'd<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who have--as who have not, that their great stars<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throned and set high?--servants, who seem no less,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which are to France the spies and speculations<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or the hard rein which both of them have borne<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against the old kind king; or something deeper,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereof perchance these are but furnishings;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, true it is, from France there comes a power<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wise in our negligence, have secret feet<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some of our best ports, and are at point<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To show their open banner. Now to you:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If on my credit you dare build so far<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make your speed to Dover, you shall find<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some that will thank you, making just report<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The king hath cause to plain.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, from some knowledge and assurance, offer<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This office to you.<br /><br />Gentleman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will talk further with you.<br /><br />KENT<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, do not.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For confirmation that I am much more<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than my out-wall, open this purse, and take<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As fear not but you shall,--show her this ring;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And she will tell you who your fellow is<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will go seek the king.<br /><br />Gentleman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me your hand: have you no more to say?<br /><br />KENT<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That, when we have found the king,--in which your pain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That way, I'll this,--he that first lights on him<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holla the other.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exeunt severally<br /></span><span id = 444 ><br /><br />SCENE II.

Fields near Dover.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter GLOUCESTER, and EDGAR dressed like a peasant <br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When shall we come to the top of that same hill?<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You do climb up it now: look, how we labour.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Methinks the ground is even.<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Horrible steep.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hark, do you hear the sea?<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, truly.<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By your eyes' anguish.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So may it be, indeed:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Methinks thy voice is alter'd; and thou speak'st<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In better phrase and matter than thou didst.<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're much deceived: in nothing am I changed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in my garments.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Methinks you're better spoken.<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come on, sir; here's the place: stand still. How fearful<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The crows and choughs that wing the midway air<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Topple down headlong.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set me where you stand.<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me your hand: you are now within a foot<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would I not leap upright.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let go my hand.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, friend, 's another purse; in it a jewel<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well worth a poor man's taking: fairies and gods<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prosper it with thee! Go thou farther off;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now fare you well, good sir.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With all my heart.<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why I do trifle thus with his despair<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is done to cure it.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Kneeling] O you mighty gods!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shake patiently my great affliction off:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I could bear it longer, and not fall<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My snuff and loathed part of nature should<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, fellow, fare thee well.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He falls forward<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gone, sir: farewell.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet I know not how conceit may rob<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The treasury of life, when life itself<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yields to the theft: had he been where he thought,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this, had thought been past. Alive or dead?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ho, you sir! friend! Hear you, sir! speak!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are you, sir?<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Away, and let me die.<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So many fathom down precipitating,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg: but thou dost breathe;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten masts at each make not the altitude<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But have I fall'n, or no?<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look up a-height; the shrill-gorged lark so far<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alack, I have no eyes.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is wretchedness deprived that benefit,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And frustrate his proud will.<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me your arm:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up: so. How is 't? Feel you your legs? You stand.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too well, too well.<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is above all strangeness.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the crown o' the cliff, what thing was that<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which parted from you?<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A poor unfortunate beggar.<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I stood here below, methought his eyes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Horns whelk'd and waved like the enridged sea:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of men's impossibilities, have preserved thee.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do remember now: henceforth I'll bear<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Affliction till it do cry out itself<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took it for a man; often 'twould say<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The fiend, the fiend:' he led me to that place.<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter KING LEAR, fantastically dressed with wild flowers<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The safer sense will ne'er accommodate<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His master thus.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, they cannot touch me for coining; I am the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; king himself.<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O thou side-piercing sight!<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nature's above art in that respect. There's your<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crow-keeper: draw me a clothier's yard. Look,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece of toasted<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cheese will do 't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flown, bird! i' the clout, i' the clout: hewgh!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give the word.<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet marjoram.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that voice.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flattered<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me like a dog; and told me I had white hairs in my<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay'<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and 'no' to every thing that I said!--'Ay' and 'no'<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; too was no good divinity. When the rain came to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they are<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not men o' their words: they told me I was every<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thing; 'tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trick of that voice I do well remember:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is 't not the king?<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ay, every inch a king:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? Adultery?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does lecher in my sight.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was kinder to his father than my daughters<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Got 'tween the lawful sheets.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To 't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold yond simpering dame,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose face between her forks presages snow;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That minces virtue, and does shake the head<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To hear of pleasure's name;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to 't<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a more riotous appetite.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down from the waist they are Centaurs,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though women all above:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But to the girdle do the gods inherit,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath is all the fiends';<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's hell, there's darkness, there's the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sulphurous pit,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burning, scalding, stench, consumption; fie,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there's money for thee.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O, let me kiss that hand!<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; love. Read thou this challenge; mark but the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; penning of it.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would not take this from report; it is,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And my heart breaks at it.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What, with the case of eyes?<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a heavy case, your purse in a light; yet you see how<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this world goes.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see it feelingly.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yond<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark, in<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a farmer's dog bark at a beggar?<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ay, sir.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the creature run from the cur? There thou<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mightst behold the great image of authority: a<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dog's obeyed in office.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw does pierce it.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None does offend, none, I say, none; I'll able 'em:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take that of me, my friend, who have the power<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And like a scurvy politician, seem<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pull off my boots: harder, harder: so.<br /><br />EDGAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O, matter and impertinency mix'd! Reason in madness!<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou must be patient; we came crying hither:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.<br /><br />GLOUCESTER<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alack, alack the day!<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we are born, we cry that we are come<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To this great stage of fools: this a good block;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It were a delicate stratagem, to shoe<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A troop of horse with felt: I'll put 't in proof;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter a Gentleman, with Attendants<br /><br />Gentleman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O, here he is: lay hand upon him. Sir,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your most dear daughter--<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am cut to the brains.<br /><br />Gentleman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You shall have any thing.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No seconds? all myself?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, this would make a man a man of salt,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To use his eyes for garden water-pots,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ay, and laying autumn's dust.<br /><br />Gentleman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good sir,--<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will die bravely, like a bridegroom. What!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be jovial: come, come; I am a king,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My masters, know you that.<br /><br />Gentleman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are a royal one, and we obey you.<br /><br />KING LEAR<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there's life in't. Nay, if you get it, you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall get it with running. Sa, sa, sa, sa.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit running; Attendants follow<br /><br />Gentleman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Past speaking of in a king!
