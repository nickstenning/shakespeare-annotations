Orchard of Oliver's house.</h3><blockquote><i>Enter ORLANDO and ADAM</i></blockquote><a><b>ORLANDO</b></a><blockquote><a>As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion</a><br /><a>bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,</a><br /><a>and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his</a><br /><a>blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my</a><br /><a>sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and</a><br /><a>report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,</a><br /><a>he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more</a><br /><a>properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you</a><br /><a>that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that</a><br /><a>differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses</a><br /><a>are bred better; for, besides that they are fair</a><br /><a>with their feeding, they are taught their manage,</a><br /><a>and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his</a><br /><a>brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the</a><br /><a>which his animals on his dunghills are as much</a><br /><a>bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so</a><br /><a>plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave</a><br /><a>me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets</a><br /><a>me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a</a><br /><a>brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my</a><br /><a>gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that</a><br /><a>grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I</a><br /><a>think is within me, begins to mutiny against this</a><br /><a>servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I</a><br /><a>know no wise remedy how to avoid it.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>ADAM</b></a><blockquote><a>Yonder comes my master, your brother.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>ORLANDO</b></a><blockquote><a>Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will</a><br /><a>shake me up.</a><br /><p><i>Enter OLIVER</i></p></blockquote><a><b>OLIVER</b></a><blockquote><a>Now, sir! what make you here?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>ORLANDO</b></a><blockquote><a>Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>OLIVER</b></a><blockquote><a>What mar you then, sir?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>ORLANDO</b></a><blockquote><a>Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God</a><br /><a>made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>OLIVER</b></a><blockquote><a>Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>ORLANDO</b></a><blockquote><a>Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?</a><br /><a>What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should</a><br /><a>come to such penury?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>OLIVER</b></a><blockquote><a>Know you where your are, sir?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>ORLANDO</b></a><blockquote><a>O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>OLIVER</b></a><blockquote><a>Know you before whom, sir?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>ORLANDO</b></a><blockquote><a>Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know</a><br /><a>you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle</a><br /><a>condition of blood, you should so know me. The</a><br /><a>courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that</a><br /><a>you are the first-born; but the same tradition</a><br /><a>takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers</a><br /><a>betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as</a><br /><a>you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is</a><br /><a>nearer to his reverence.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>OLIVER</b></a><blockquote><a>What, boy!</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>ORLANDO</b></a><blockquote><a>Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>OLIVER</b></a><blockquote><a>Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>ORLANDO</b></a><blockquote><a>I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir</a><br /><a>Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice</a><br /><a>a villain that says such a father begot villains.</a><br /><a>Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand</a><br /><a>from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy</a><br /><a>tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>ADAM</b></a><blockquote><a>Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's</a><br /><a>remembrance, be at accord.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>OLIVER</b></a><blockquote><a>Let me go, I say.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>ORLANDO</b></a><blockquote><a>I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My</a><br /><a>father charged you in his will to give me good</a><br /><a>education: you have trained me like a peasant,</a><br /><a>obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like</a><br /><a>qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in</a><br /><a>me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow</a><br /><a>me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or</a><br /><a>give me the poor allottery my father left me by</a><br /><a>testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>OLIVER</b></a><blockquote><a>And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?</a><br /><a>Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled</a><br /><a>with you; you shall have some part of your will: I</a><br /><a>pray you, leave me.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>ORLANDO</b></a><blockquote><a>I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>OLIVER</b></a><blockquote><a>Get you with him, you old dog.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>ADAM</b></a><blockquote><a>Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my</a><br /><a>teeth in your service. God be with my old master!</a><br /><a>he would not have spoke such a word.</a><br /><p><i>Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM</i></p></blockquote><a><b>OLIVER</b></a><blockquote><a>Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will</a><br /><a>physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand</a><br /><a>crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!</a><br /><p><i>Enter DENNIS</i></p></blockquote><a><b>DENNIS</b></a><blockquote><a>Calls your worship?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>OLIVER</b></a><blockquote><a>Was not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>DENNIS</b></a><blockquote><a>So please you, he is here at the door and importunes</a><br /><a>access to you.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>OLIVER</b></a><blockquote><a>Call him in.</a><br /><p><i>Exit DENNIS</i></p><a>'Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.</a><br /><p><i>Enter CHARLES</i></p></blockquote><a><b>CHARLES</b></a><blockquote><a>Good morrow to your worship.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>OLIVER</b></a><blockquote><a>Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the</a><br /><a>new court?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CHARLES</b></a><blockquote><a>There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:</a><br /><a>that is, the old duke is banished by his younger</a><br /><a>brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords</a><br /><a>have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,</a><br /><a>whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;</a><br /><a>therefore he gives them good leave to wander.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>OLIVER</b></a><blockquote><a>Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be</a><br /><a>banished with her father?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CHARLES</b></a><blockquote><a>O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves</a><br /><a>her, being ever from their cradles bred together,</a><br /><a>that she would have followed her exile, or have died</a><br /><a>to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no</a><br /><a>less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and</a><br /><a>never two ladies loved as they do.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>OLIVER</b></a><blockquote><a>Where will the old duke live?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CHARLES</b></a><blockquote><a>They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and</a><br /><a>a many merry men with him; and there they live like</a><br /><a>the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young</a><br /><a>gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time</a><br /><a>carelessly, as they did in the golden world.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>OLIVER</b></a><blockquote><a>What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CHARLES</b></a><blockquote><a>Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a</a><br /><a>matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand</a><br /><a>that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition</a><br /><a>to come in disguised against me to try a fall.</a><br /><a>To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that</a><br /><a>escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him</a><br /><a>well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,</a><br /><a>for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I</a><br /><a>must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,</a><br /><a>out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you</a><br /><a>withal, that either you might stay him from his</a><br /><a>intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall</a><br /><a>run into, in that it is a thing of his own search</a><br /><a>and altogether against my will.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>OLIVER</b></a><blockquote><a>Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which</a><br /><a>thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had</a><br /><a>myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and</a><br /><a>have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from</a><br /><a>it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:</a><br /><a>it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full</a><br /><a>of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's</a><br /><a>good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against</a><br /><a>me his natural brother: therefore use thy</a><br /><a>discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck</a><br /><a>as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if</a><br /><a>thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not</a><br /><a>mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise</a><br /><a>against thee by poison, entrap thee by some</a><br /><a>treacherous device and never leave thee till he</a><br /><a>hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;</a><br /><a>for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak</a><br /><a>it, there is not one so young and so villanous this</a><br /><a>day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but</a><br /><a>should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must</a><br /><a>blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CHARLES</b></a><blockquote><a>I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come</a><br /><a>to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go</a><br /><a>alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and</a><br /><a>so God keep your worship!</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>OLIVER</b></a><blockquote><a>Farewell, good Charles.</a><br /><p><i>Exit CHARLES</i></p><a>Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see</a><br /><a>an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,</a><br /><a>hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never</a><br /><a>schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of</a><br /><a>all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much</a><br /><a>in the heart of the world, and especially of my own</a><br /><a>people, who best know him, that I am altogether</a><br /><a>misprised: but it shall not be so long; this</a><br /><a>wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that</a><br /><a>I kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.</a><br /><p><i>Exit</i></p></blockquote></span><span id = 549 ><h3>SCENE II.

In respect that it is solitary, I</a><br /><a>like it very well; but in respect that it is</a><br /><a>private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it</a><br /><a>is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in</a><br /><a>respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As</a><br /><a>is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;</a><br /><a>but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much</a><br /><a>against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CORIN</b></a><blockquote><a>No more but that I know the more one sickens the</a><br /><a>worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,</a><br /><a>means and content is without three good friends;</a><br /><a>that the property of rain is to wet and fire to</a><br /><a>burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a</a><br /><a>great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that</a><br /><a>he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may</a><br /><a>complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>TOUCHSTONE</b></a><blockquote><a>Such a one is a natural philosopher.

Your reason.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>TOUCHSTONE</b></a><blockquote><a>Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest</a><br /><a>good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,</a><br /><a>then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is</a><br /><a>sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous</a><br /><a>state, shepherd.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CORIN</b></a><blockquote><a>Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners</a><br /><a>at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the</a><br /><a>behavior of the country is most mockable at the</a><br /><a>court. You told me you salute not at the court, but</a><br /><a>you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be</a><br /><a>uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>TOUCHSTONE</b></a><blockquote><a>Instance, briefly; come, instance.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CORIN</b></a><blockquote><a>Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their</a><br /><a>fells, you know, are greasy.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>TOUCHSTONE</b></a><blockquote><a>Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not</a><br /><a>the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of</a><br /><a>a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CORIN</b></a><blockquote><a>Besides, our hands are hard.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>TOUCHSTONE</b></a><blockquote><a>Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.</a><br /><a>A more sounder instance, come.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CORIN</b></a><blockquote><a>And they are often tarred over with the surgery of</a><br /><a>our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The</a><br /><a>courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>TOUCHSTONE</b></a><blockquote><a>Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a</a><br /><a>good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and</a><br /><a>perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the</a><br /><a>very uncleanly flux of a cat.
