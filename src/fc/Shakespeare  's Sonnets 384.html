would be brought,<br />From limits far remote, where thou dost stay.<br />No matter then although my foot did stand<br />Upon the farthest earth remov'd from thee;<br />For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,<br />As soon as think the place where he would be.<br />But, ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,<br />To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,<br />But that so much of earth and water wrought,<br />I must attend time's leisure with my moan;<br />Receiving nought by elements so slow<br />But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.</span><span id = 18525 >The other two, slight air, and purging fire<br />Are both with thee, wherever I abide;<br />The first my thought, the other my desire,<br />These present-absent with swift motion slide.<br />For when these quicker elements are gone<br />In tender embassy of love to thee,<br />My life, being made of four, with two alone<br />Sinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy;<br />Until life's composition be recured<br />By those swift messengers return'd from thee,<br />Who even but now come back again, assured<br />Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:<br />This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,<br />I send them back again, and straight grow sad.</span><span id = 18526 >Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,<br />How to divide the conquest of thy sight;<br />Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,<br />My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.<br />My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,<br />A closet never pierc'd with crystal eyes,<br />But the defendant doth that plea deny,<br />And says in him thy fair appearance lies.<br />To 'cide this title is impannelled<br />A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart;<br />And by their verdict is determined<br />The clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part:<br />As thus: mine eye's due is thine outward part,<br />And my heart's right, thine inward love of heart.</span><span id = 18527 >Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,<br />And each doth good turns now unto the other:<br />When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,<br />Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,<br />With my love's picture then my eye doth feast,<br />And to the painted banquet bids my heart;<br />Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,<br />And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:<br />So, either by thy picture or my love,<br />Thy self away, art present still with me;<br />For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,<br />And I am still with them, and they with thee;<br />Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight<br />Awakes my heart, to heart's and eyes' delight.</span><span id = 18528 >How careful was I when I took my way,<br />Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,<br />That to my use it might unused stay<br />From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!<br />But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,<br />Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,<br />Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,<br />Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.<br />Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest,<br />Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,<br />Within the gentle closure of my breast,<br />From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;<br />And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear,<br />For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.</span><span id = 18529 >Against that time, if ever that time come,<br />When I shall see thee frown on my defects,<br />When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,<br />Called to that audit by advis'd respects;<br />Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,<br />And scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye,<br />When love, converted from the thing it was,<br />Shall reasons find of settled gravity;<br />Against that time do I ensconce me here,<br />Within the knowledge of mine own desert,<br />And this my hand, against my self uprear,<br />To guard the lawful reasons on thy part:<br />To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,<br />Since why to love I can allege no cause.</span><span id = 18530 >How heavy do I journey on the way,<br />When what I seek, my weary travel's end,<br />Doth teach that ease and that repose to say,<br />'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!'<br />The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,<br />Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,<br />As if by some instinct the wretch did know<br />His rider lov'd not speed being made from thee.<br />The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,<br />That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,<br />Which heavily he answers with a groan,<br />More sharp to me than spurring to his side;<br />For that same groan doth put this in my mind,<br />My grief lies onward, and my joy behind.</span><span id = 18531 >When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes<br />I all alone beweep my outcast state,<br />And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,<br />And look upon myself, and curse my fate,<br />Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,<br />Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,<br />Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,<br />With what I most enjoy contented least;<br />Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,<br />Haply I think on thee, and then my state,<br />Like to the lark at break of day arising<br />From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;<br />For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings<br />That then I scorn to change my state with kings.</span>
