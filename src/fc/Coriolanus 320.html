A public place. <br /><br />[Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS, with attendants.] <br /><br />AUFIDIUS. Go tell the lords o' the city I am here: Deliver them this paper; having read it, Bid them repair to the market-place: where I, Even in theirs and in the commons' ears, Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse The city ports by this hath enter'd and Intends t' appear before the people, hoping To purge himself with words: despatch.<br /><br /><br />[Exeunt attendants.] <br /><br />[Enter three or four CONSPIRATORS of AUFIDIUS' faction.] <br /><br />Most welcome! <br /><br />FIRST CONSPIRATOR. How is it with our general? <br /><br />AUFIDIUS. Even so As with a man by his own alms empoison'd, And with his charity slain. <br /><br />SECOND CONSPIRATOR. Most noble sir, If you do hold the same intent wherein You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you Of your great danger. <br /><br />AUFIDIUS. Sir, I cannot tell: We must proceed as we do find the people. <br /><br />THIRD CONSPIRATOR. The people will remain uncertain whilst 'Twixt you there's difference: but the fall of either Makes the survivor heir of all. <br /><br />AUFIDIUS. I know it; And my pretext to strike at him admits A good construction. I rais'd him, and I pawn'd Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd, He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery, Seducing so my friends; and to this end He bow'd his nature, never known before But to be rough, unswayable, and free. <br /><br />THIRD CONSPIRATOR. Sir, his stoutness When he did stand for consul, which he lost By lack of stooping. <br /><br />AUFIDIUS. That I would have spoken of: Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth; Presented to my knife his throat: I took him; Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way In all his own desires; nay, let him choose Out of my files, his projects to accomplish, My best and freshest men; serv'd his designments In mine own person; holp to reap the fame Which he made all his; and took some pride To do myself this wrong: till, at the last, I seem'd his follower, not partner; and He wag'd me with his countenance as if I had been mercenary. <br /><br />FIRST CONSPIRATOR. So he did, my lord: The army marvell'd at it; and, in the last, When he had carried Rome, and that we look'd For no less spoil than glory, AUFIDIUS. There was it; For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him. At a few drops of women's rheum, which are As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour Of our great action: therefore shall he die, And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark! <br /><br />[Drums and trumpets sound, with great shouts of the people.]<br />FIRST CONSPIRATOR. Your native town you enter'd like a post, And had no welcomes home; but he returns Splitting the air with noise. <br /><br />SECOND CONSPIRATOR. And patient fools, Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear With giving him glory. <br /><br />THIRD CONSPIRATOR. Therefore, at your vantage, Ere he express himself or move the people With what he would say, let him feel your sword, Which we will second. When he lies along, After your way his tale pronounc'd shall bury His reasons with his body. <br /><br />AUFIDIUS. Say no more: Here come the lords. <br /><br />[Enter the LORDS of the city.] <br /><br />LORDS. You are most welcome home. <br /><br />AUFIDIUS. I have not deserv'd it. But, worthy lords, have you with heed perus'd What I have written to you? <br /><br />LORDS. We have.<br /><br />FIRST LORD. And grieve to hear't. What faults he made before the last, I think Might have found easy fines: but there to end Where he was to begin, and give away The benefit of our levies, answering us With our own charge: making a treaty where There was a yielding. This admits no excuse.<br /><br />AUFIDIUS. He approaches: you shall hear him. <br /><br />[Enter CORIOLANUS, with drum and colours; a crowd of Citizens with him.] <br /><br />CORIOLANUS. Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier; No more infected with my country's love Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting Under your great command. You are to know That prosperously I have attempted, and With bloody passage led your wars even to The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home Do more than counterpoise a full third part The charges of the action. We have made peace With no less honour to the Antiates Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver, Subscribed by the consuls and patricians, Together with the seal o' the senate, what We have compounded on. <br /><br />AUFIDIUS. Read it not, noble lords; But tell the traitor, in the highest degree He hath abus'd your powers.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS. Traitor! How now? <br /><br />AUFIDIUS. Ay, traitor, Marcius. <br /><br />CORIOLANUS. Marcius! <br /><br />AUFIDIUS. Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius! Dost thou think I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name Coriolanus, in Corioli? You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously He has betray'd your business, and given up, For certain drops of salt, your city Rome, I say your city, to his wife and mother; Breaking his oath and resolution, like A twist of rotten silk; never admitting Counsel o' the war; but at his nurse's tears He whin'd and roar'd away your victory; That pages blush'd at him, and men of heart Look'd wondering each at others. <br /><br />CORIOLANUS. Hear'st thou, Mars? <br /><br />AUFIDIUS. Name not the god, thou boy of tears, <br /><br />CORIOLANUS. Ha!<br /><br />AUFIDIUS. No more. <br /><br />CORIOLANUS. Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave! Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever I was forc'd to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords, Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion, Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that must bear My beating to his grave, shall join to thrust The lie unto him. <br /><br />FIRST LORD. Peace, both, and hear me speak. <br /><br />CORIOLANUS. Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads, Stain all your edges on me. Boy! False hound! If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there, That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli: Alone I did it. Boy! <br /><br />AUFIDIUS. Why, noble lords, Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune, Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart, 'Fore your own eyes and ears? <br /><br />CONSPIRATORS. Let him die for't. <br /><br />CITIZENS. Tear him to pieces, do it presently: he killed my son; my daughter; he killed my cousin Marcus; he killed my father, <br /><br />SECOND LORD. Peace, ho! no outrage; peace! The man is noble, and his fame folds in This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius, And trouble not the peace.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS. O that I had him, With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe, To use my lawful sword! <br /><br />AUFIDIUS. Insolent villain! <br /><br />CONSPIRATORS. Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him! <br /><br />[AUFIDIUS and the CONSPIRATORS draw, and kill CORIOLANUS, who falls. AUFIDIUS stands on him.] <br /><br />LORDS. Hold, hold, hold, hold! <br /><br />AUFIDIUS. My noble masters, hear me speak.<br /><br />FIRST LORD. O Tullus,<br />SECOND LORD. Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep. <br /><br />THIRD LORD. Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet; Put up your swords. <br /><br />AUFIDIUS. My lords, when you shall know, as in this rage, Provok'd by him, you cannot, the great danger Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours To call me to your senate, I'll deliver Myself your loyal servant, or endure Your heaviest censure. <br /><br />FIRST LORD. Bear from hence his body, And mourn you for him. Let him be regarded As the most noble corse that ever herald Did follow to his um.<br /><br />SECOND LORD. His own impatience Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame. Let's make the best of it. AUFIDIUS. My rage is gone; And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up: Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one. Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully; Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one, Which to this hour bewail the injury, Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist.<br /><br />[Exeunt, bearing the body of CORIOLANUS.

For an end, We must suggest the people in what hatred He stillhath held them; that to's power he would Have made them mules, silenc'd theirpleaders, and Dispropertied their freedoms; holding them, In human action andcapacity, Of no more soul nor fitness for the world Than camels in their war;who have their provand Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows For sinkingunder them.</p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">SICINIUS.

How many stand for consulships? <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND OFFICER. Three, they say; but 'tis thought of every one Coriolanus will carry it. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST OFFICER. That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud and loves not the common people. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND OFFICER. Faith, there have been many great men that have flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there be many that they have loved, they know not wherefore; so that, if they love they know not why, they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition; and, out of his noble carelessness, lets them plainly see't. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST OFFICER. If he did not care whether he had their love or no, he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither good nor harm; but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render it him; and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite. Now to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for their love. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND OFFICER. He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who, having been supple and courteous to the people, bonnetted, without any further deed to have them at all, into their estimation and report: but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions in their hearts, that for their tongues to be silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of ingrateful injury; to report otherwise were a malice that, giving itself the lie, would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST OFFICER. No more of him; he is a worthy man.: make way, they are coming. <br />&nbsp; <br />[A sennet. Enter, with Lictors before them, COMINIUS the Consul, MENENIUS, CORIOLANUS, Senators, SICINIUS and BRUTUS. The Senators <br />&nbsp; <br />take their places; the Tribunes take theirs also by themselves.] <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Having determined of the Volsces, and To send for Titus Lartius, it remains, As the main point of this our after-meeting, To gratify his noble service that Hath thus stood for his country: therefore please you, Most reverend and grave elders, to desire The present consul, and last general In our well-found successes, to report A little of that worthy work perform'd By Caius Marcius Coriolanus; whom We met here both to thank and to remember With honours like himself. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST SENATOR. Speak, good Cominius: Leave nothing out for length, and make us think Rather our state's defective for requital Than we to stretch it out. Masters o' the people, We do request your kindest ears; and, after, Your loving motion toward the common body, To yield what passes here. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. We are convented Upon a pleasing treaty; and have hearts Inclinable to honour and advance The theme of our assembly. <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. Which the rather We shall be bless'd to do, if he remember A kinder value of the people than He hath hereto priz'd them at. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. That's off, that's off; I would you rather had been silent. Please you To hear Cominius speak? <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. Most willingly. But yet my caution was more pertinent Than the rebuke you give it. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. He loves your people; But tie him not to be their bedfellow. Worthy Cominius, speak. <br />&nbsp; <br />[CORIOLANUS rises, and offers to go away.] <br />&nbsp; <br />Nay, keep your place. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST SENATOR. Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear What you have nobly done. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Your Honours' pardon: I had rather have my wounds to heal again Than hear say how I got them. <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. Sir, I hope My words disbench'd you not. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. No, sir; yet oft, When blows have made me stay, I fled from words. You sooth'd not, therefore hurt not: but your people, I love them as they weigh. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Pray now, sit down. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun When the alarum were struck, than idly sit To hear my nothings monster'd. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Exit.] <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Masters o' the people, Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter, That's thousand to one good one, when you now see He had rather venture all his limbs for honour Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius. <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held That valour is the chiefest virtue, and Most dignifies the haver: if it be, The man I speak of cannot in the world Be singly counterpois'd. At sixteen years, When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought Beyond the mark of others; our then dictator, Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight, When with his Amazonian chin he drove The bristled lips before him: he bestrid An o'erpress'd Roman and i' the consul's view Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met, And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats, When he might act the woman in the scene, He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea; And in the brunt of seventeen battles since He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last, Before and in Corioli, let me say, I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers; And by his rare example made the coward Turn terror into sport: as weeds before A vessel under sail, so men obey'd, And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp, Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot He was a thing of blood, whose every motion Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd The mortal gate of the city, which he painted With shun less destiny; aidless came off, And with a sudden re-enforcement struck Corioli like a planet. Now all's his: When, by and by, the din of war 'gan pierce His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit Re-quick'ned what in flesh was fatigate, And to the battle came he; where he did Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if 'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd Both field and city ours he never stood To ease his breast with panting. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Worthy man! <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST SENATOR. He cannot but with measure fit the honours Which we devise him. <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. Our spoils he kick'd at; And looked upon things precious as they were The common muck of the world: he covets less Than misery itself would give; rewards His deeds with doing them; and is content To spend the time to end it. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. He's right noble: Let him be call'd for. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST SENATOR. Call Coriolanus. <br />&nbsp; <br />OFFICER. He doth appear. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Re-enter CORIOLANUS.] <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. The Senate, Coriolanus, are well pleas'd To make thee consul. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. I do owe them still My life and services. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. It then remains That you do speak to the people. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. I do beseech you Let me o'erleap that custom; for I cannot Put on the gown, stand naked, and entreat them, For my wounds' sake to give their suffrage: please you That I may pass this doing. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Sir, the people Must have their voices; neither will they bate One jot of ceremony. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Put them not to't: Pray you, go fit you to the custom; and Take to you, as your predecessors have, Your honour with your form. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. It is a part That I shall blush in acting, and might well Be taken from the people. <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. Mark you that? <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus; Show them the unaching scars which I should hide, As if I had receiv'd them for the hire Of their breath only! <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Do not stand upon't. We recommend to you, tribunes of the people, Our purpose to them; and to our noble consul Wish we all joy and honour. <br />&nbsp; <br />SENATORS. To Coriolanus come all joy and honour! <br />&nbsp; <br />[Flourish. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS.] <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. You see how he intends to use the people. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. May they perceive's intent! He will require them As if he did contemn what he requested Should be in them to give. <br />BRUTUS. Come, we'll inform them Of our proceedings here: on the market-place I know they do attend us.<br /></span><span id = 14276 >Rome. The Forum. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter several citizens.] <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST CITIZEN. Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND CITIZEN. We may, sir, if we will. <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD CITIZEN. We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a power that we have no power to do: for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is monstrous: and for the multitude to be in-grateful were to make a monster of the multitude; of which we being members should bring ourselves to be monstrous members. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST CITIZEN. And to make us no better thought of, a little help will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude. <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD CITIZEN. We have been called so of many; not that our heads are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald, but that our wits are so diversely coloured; and truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south; and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o' the compass. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND CITIZEN. Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would fly? <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD CITIZEN. Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's will, 'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head; but if it were at liberty 'twould, sure, southward. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND CITIZEN. Why that way? <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD CITIZEN. To lose itself in a fog; where being three parts melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return for conscience' sake, to help to get thee a wife. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND CITIZEN. You are never without your tricks: you may, you may. <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD CITIZEN. Are you all resolved to give your voices? But that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I say, if he would incline to the people, there was never a worthier man. Here he comes, and in the gown of humility. Mark his behaviour. We are not to stay all together, but to come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and by threes. He's to make his requests by particulars, wherein every one of us has a single honour, in giving him our own voices with our own tongues; therefore follow me, and I'll direct you how you shall go by him. <br />&nbsp; <br />ALL. Content, content. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Exeunt.] <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS.] <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; MENENIUS. O sir, you are not right; have you not known The worthiest men have done't! <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. What must I say? 'I pray, sir' Plague upon't! I cannot bring My tongue to such a pace. 'Look, sir, my wounds; I got them in my country's service, when Some certain of your brethren roar'd, and ran From the noise of our own drums.' <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. O me, the gods! You must not speak of that: you must desire them To think upon you. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Think upon me! Hang 'em! I would they would forget me, like the virtues Which our divines lose by 'em. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. You'll mar all: I'll leave you. Pray you speak to 'em, I pray you, In wholesome manner. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Bid them wash their faces And keep their teeth clean. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Exit MENENIUS.] <br />&nbsp; <br />So, here comes a brace: <br />&nbsp; <br />[Re-enter two citizens.] <br />&nbsp; <br />You know the cause, sirs, of my standing here. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST CITIZEN. We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Mine own desert. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND CITIZEN. Your own desert? <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Ay, not mine own desire. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST CITIZEN. How! not your own desire! <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. No, sir, 'twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST CITIZEN. You must think, if we give you anything, we hope to gain by you. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship? <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST CITIZEN. The price is to ask it kindly. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Kindly! sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to show you, which shall be yours in private. Your good voice, sir; what say you? <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND CITIZEN. You shall ha' it, worthy sir. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices begg'd. I have your alms: adieu. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST CITIZEN. But this is something odd. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND CITIZEN. An 'twere to give again, but 'tis no matter. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Exeunt two citizens.] <br />&nbsp; <br />[Re-enter other two citizens.] <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voices that I may be consul, I have here the customary gown. <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD CITIZEN. You have deserved nobly of your country, and you have not deserved nobly. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Your enigma? <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD CITIZEN. You have been a scourge to her enemies; you have been a rod to her friends: you have not indeed loved the common people. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. You should account me the more virtuous, that I have not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly: that is, sir, I will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountifully to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you, I may be consul. <br />&nbsp; <br />FOURTH CITIZEN. We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give you our voices heartily. <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD CITIZEN. You have received many wounds for your country. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further. <br />&nbsp; <br />BOTH CITIZENS. The gods give you joy, sir, heartily! <br />&nbsp; <br />[Exeunt citizens.] <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Most sweet voices! Better it is to die, better to starve, Than crave the hire which first we do deserve. Why in this wolvish toge should I stand here, To beg of Hob and Dick that do appear, Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't: What custom wills, in all things should we do't, The dust on antique time would lie un-swept, And mountainous error be too highly heap'd For truth to o'erpeer. Rather than fool it so, Let the high office and the honour go To one that would do thus. I am half through; The one part suffer'd, the other will I do. Here come more voices. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Re-enter other three citizens.] <br />&nbsp; <br />Your voices: for your voices I have fought; Watch'd for your voices; for your voices bear Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six I have seen and heard of; for your voices have Done many things, some less, some more: your voices: Indeed, I would be consul. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIFTH CITIZEN. He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest man's voice. <br />&nbsp; <br />SIXTH CITIZEN. Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy, and make him good friend to the people! <br />&nbsp; <br />ALL THREE CITIZENS. Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul! <br />&nbsp; <br />[Exeunt.] <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Worthy voices! <br />&nbsp; <br />[Re-enter MENENIUS, with BRUTUS and SICINIUS.] <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes Endue you with the people's voice: remains That, in the official marks invested, you Anon do meet the senate. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Is this done? <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. The custom of request you have discharg'd: The people do admit you; and are summon'd To meet anon, upon your approbation. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Where? at the senate-house? <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. There, Coriolanus. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. May I change these garments? <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. You may, sir. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again, Repair to the senate-house. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. I'll keep you company. Will you along? <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. We stay here for the people. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Fare you well. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS.] <br />&nbsp; <br />He has it now; and by his looks methinks 'Tis warm at his heart. <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds. Will you dismiss the people? <br />&nbsp; <br />[Re-enter citizens.] <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. How now, my masters! have you chose this man? <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST CITIZEN. He has our voices, sir. <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. We pray the gods he may deserve your loves. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND CITIZEN. Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice, He mocked us when he begg'd our voices. <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD CITIZEN. Certainly; He flouted us downright. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST CITIZEN. No, 'tis his kind of speech, he did not mock us. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND CITIZEN. Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says He us'd us scornfully: he should have show'd us His marks of merit, wounds received for's country. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Why, so he did, I am sure. <br />&nbsp; <br />CITIZENS. No, no; no man saw 'em. <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD CITIZEN. He said he had wounds, which he could show in private; And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn, 'I would be consul,' says he; 'aged custom But by your voices, will not so permit me; Your voices therefore:' when we granted that, Here was, 'I thank you for your voices, thank you, Your most sweet voices: now you have left your voices I have no further with you:' was not this mockery? <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Why either were you ignorant to see't? Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness To yield your voices? <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. Could you not have told him, As you were lesson'd, when he had no power, But was a petty servant to the state, He was your enemy; ever spake against Your liberties, and the charters that you bear I' the body of the weal: and now, arriving A place of potency and sway o' the state, If he should still malignantly remain Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might Be curses to yourselves? You should have said, That as his worthy deeds did claim no less Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature Would think upon you for your voices, and Translate his malice towards you into love, Standing your friendly lord. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Thus to have said, As you were fore-advis'd, had touch'd his spirit And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd Either his gracious promise, which you might, As cause had call'd you up, have held him to; Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature, Which easily endures not article Tying him to aught; so, putting him to rage, You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler And pass'd him unelected. <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. Did you perceive He did solicit you in free contempt When he did need your loves; and do you think That his contempt shall not be bruising to you When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies No heart among you? Or had you tongues to cry Against the rectorship of judgment? <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Have you Ere now denied the asker, and now again, Of him that did not ask but mock, bestow Your su'd-for tongues? <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD CITIZEN. He's not confirm'd: we may deny him yet. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND CITIZEN. And will deny him: I'll have five hundred voices of that sound. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST CITIZEN. I twice five hundred, and their friends to piece 'em. <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. Get you hence instantly; and tell those friends They have chose a consul that will from them take Their liberties, make them of no more voice Than dogs, that are as often beat for barking As therefore kept to do so. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Let them assemble; And, on a safer judgment, all revoke Your ignorant election: enforce his pride And his old hate unto you: besides, forget not With what contempt he wore the humble weed; How in his suit he scorn'd you: but your loves, Thinking upon his services, took from you Th' apprehension of his present portance, Which, most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion After the inveterate hate he bears you. <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. Lay A fault on us, your tribunes; that we labour'd, No impediment between, but that you must Cast your election on him. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Say you chose him More after our commandment than as guided By your own true affections; and that your minds, Pre-occupied with what you rather must do Than what you should, made you against the grain To voice him consul. Lay the fault on us. <br /><br />BRUTUS. Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you, How youngly he began to serve his country, How long continued: and what stock he springs of The noble house o' the Marcians; from whence came That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son, Who, after great Hostilius, here was king; Of the same house Publius and Quintus were, That our best water brought by conduits hither; And Censorinus, darling of the people, And nobly nam'd so, twice being censor, Was his great ancestor. <br /><br />SICINIUS. One thus descended, That hath beside well in his person wrought To be set high in place, we did commend To your remembrances: but you have found, Scaling his present bearing with his past, That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke Your sudden approbation.<br />&nbsp;<br />BRUTUS. Say you ne'er had done't, Harp on that still, but by our putting on: And presently when you have drawn your number, Repair to the Capitol.<br /><br />CITIZENS. We will so; almost all Repent in their election. <br />[Exeunt.] <br /><br />BRUTUS. Let them go on; This mutiny were better put in hazard Than stay, past doubt, for greater: If, as his nature is, he fall in rage With their refusal, both observe and answer The vantage of his anger.<br /><br />SICINIUS. To the Capitol, Come: we will be there before the stream o' the people; And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own, Which we have goaded onward.<br /></span><span id = 14277 ></span><span id = 14278 ><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst">Rome.

'Twas from the canon.</p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">CORIOLANUS. 'Shall'! O good, but most unwisepatricians! why, You grave but reckless senators, have you thus Given Hydraleave to choose an officer, That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but Thehorn and noise o' the monster, wants not spirit To say he'll turn your currentin a ditch, And make your channel his? If he have power, Then vail yourignorance: if none, awake Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd, Be not ascommon fools; if you are not, Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,If they be senators: and they are no less When, both your voices blended, thegreat'st taste Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate; And such aone as he, who puts his 'shall,' His popular 'shall,' against a graver bench Thanever frown'd in Greece. By Jove himself, It makes the consuls base: and my soulaches To know, when two authorities are up, Neither supreme, how soon confusionMay enter 'twixt the gap of both and take The one by the other.</p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">COMINIUS. Well, on to the market-place.</p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">CORIOLANUS.

Well, well, no more of that.</p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">CORIOLANUS. Though there the people had moreabsolute power, I say they nourish'd disobedience, fed The ruin of the state.</p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">BRUTUS. Why shall the people give One that speaksthus their voice?</p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">CORIOLANUS. I'll give my reasons, More worthierthan their voices. They know the corn Was not our recompense, resting wellassur'd They ne'er did service for't; being press'd to the war, Even when thenavel of the state was touch'd, They would not thread the gates, this kind ofservice Did not deserve corn gratis: being i' the war, Their mutinies andrevolts, wherein they show'd Most valour, spoke not for them. The accusationWhich they have often made against the senate, All cause unborn, could never bethe motive Of our so frank donation. Well, what then? How shall this bissonmultitude digest The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express What's like to be theirwords: 'We did request it; We are the greater poll, and in true fear They gaveus our demands:' Thus we debase The nature of our seats, and make the rabbleCall our cares fears; which will in time Break ope the locks o' the senate andbring in The crows to peck the eagles. </p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">MENENIUS. Come, enough.</p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">BRUTUS. Enough, with over-measure.</p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">CORIOLANUS. No, take more: What may be sworn by,both divine and human, Seal what I end withal! This double worship, Where onepart does disdain with cause, the other Insult without all reason; wheregentry, title, wisdom, Cannot conclude but by the yea and no Of generalignorance it must omit Real necessities, and give way the while To unstableslightness: purpose so barr'd, it follows, Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore,beseech you, You that will be less fearful than discreet; That love thefundamental part of state More than you doubt the change on't; that prefer Anoble life before a long, and wish To jump a body with a dangerous physicThat's sure of death without it, at once pluck out The multitudinous tongue;let them not lick The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour Mangles truejudgment, and bereaves the state Of that integrity which should become't; Nothaving the power to do the good it would, For the ill which doth control't.</p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">BRUTUS.

Let them pull all about mine ears; present me Death on the wheel, or at wild horses' heels; Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock, That the precipitation might down stretch Below the beam of sight; yet will I still Be thus to them.<br />&nbsp;<br />FIRST PATRICIAN. You do the nobler. <br />CORIOLANUS. I muse my mother Does not approve me further, who was wont To call them woollen vassals, things created To buy and sell with groats; to show bare heads In congregations, to yawn, be still, and wonder, When one but of my ordinance stood up To speak of peace or war. <br /><br />[Enter VOLUMNIA.] <br />I talk of you: [To Volumnia.] Why did you wish me milder? Would you have me False to my nature? Rather say, I play The man I am. <br /><br />VOLUMNIA. O, sir, sir, sir, I would have had you put your power well on Before you had worn it out.<br /><br />CORIOLANUS. Let go.<br />&nbsp;<br />VOLUMNIA. You might have been enough the man you are With striving less to be so: lesser had been The thwartings of your dispositions, if You had not show'd them how ye were dispos'd, Ere they lack'd power to cross you.<br />&nbsp;<br />CORIOLANUS. Let them hang.<br />&nbsp;<br />VOLUMNIA. Ay, and burn too.<br />&nbsp;<br />[Enter MENENIUS with the SENATORS.] <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Come, come, you have been too rough, something too rough; You must return and mend it.<br />&nbsp;<br />FIRST SENATOR. There's no remedy; Unless, by not so doing, our good city Cleave in the midst, and perish.<br />&nbsp;<br />VOLUMNIA. Pray be counsell'd; I have a heart as little apt as yours, But yet a brain that leads my use of anger To better vantage.<br />&nbsp;<br />MENENIUS. Well said, noble woman! Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic For the whole state, I would put mine armour on, Which I can scarcely bear.<br />&nbsp;<br />CORIOLANUS. What must I do?<br />&nbsp;<br />MENENIUS. Return to the tribunes.<br />&nbsp;<br />CORIOLANUS. Well, what then? What then? <br /><br />MENENIUS. Repent what you have spoke.<br />&nbsp;<br />CORIOLANUS. For them? I cannot do it to the gods; Must I then do't to them? <br /><br />VOLUMNIA. You are too absolute; Though therein you can never be too noble But when extremities speak. I have heard you say Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends, I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me In peace what each of them by th' other lose That they combine not there. <br /><br />CORIOLANUS. Tush, tush!<br />&nbsp;<br />MENENIUS. A good demand.<br />&nbsp;<br />VOLUMNIA. If it be honour in your wars to seem The same you are not, which for your best ends You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse That it shall hold companionship in peace With honour as in war; since that to both It stands in like request? <br />CORIOLANUS. Why force you this?<br />&nbsp;<br />VOLUMNIA. Because that now it lies you on to speak To the people; not by your own instruction, Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you, But with such words that are but rooted in Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables Of no allowance, to your bosom's truth. Now, this no more dishonours you at all Than to take in a town with gentle words, Which else would put you to your fortune and The hazard of much blood. I would dissemble with my nature where My fortunes and my friends at stake requir'd I should do so in honour: I am in this Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles; And you will rather show our general louts How you can frown, than spend a fawn upon 'em For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard Of what that want might ruin. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Noble lady! Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so, Not what is dangerous present, but the loss Of what is past. <br />&nbsp; <br />VOLUMNIA. I pr'ythee now, my son, Go to them with this bonnet in thy hand; And thus far having stretch'd it, here be with them, Thy knee bussing the stones, for in such busines Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant More learned than the ears, waving thy head, Which often, thus correcting thy stout heart, Now humble as the ripest mulberry That will not hold the handling: or say to them Thou art their soldier, and, being bred in broils, Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess, Were fit for thee to use, as they to claim, In asking their good loves; but thou wilt frame Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far As thou hast power and person. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. This but done Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours: For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free As words to little purpose. <br />&nbsp; <br />VOLUMNIA. Pr'ythee now, Go, and be rul'd; although I know thou had'st rather Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf Than flatter him in a bower. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter COMINIUS.] <br />&nbsp; <br />Here is Cominius. <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. I have been i' the market-place; and, sir, 'tis fit You make strong party, or defend yourself By calmness or by absence: all's in anger. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Only fair speech. <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. I think 'twill serve, if he Can thereto frame his spirit. <br />&nbsp; <br />VOLUMNIA. He must, and will. Pr'ythee now, say you will, and go about it. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Must I go show them my unbarb'd sconce? must I With my base tongue, give to my noble heart A lie, that it must bear? Well, I will do't: Yet, were there but this single plot to lose, This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it, And throw't against the wind. To the market-place: You have put me now to such a part which never I shall discharge to the life. <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. Come, come, we'll prompt you. <br />&nbsp; <br />VOLUMNIA. I pr'ythee now, sweet son, as thou hast said My praises made thee first a soldier, so, To have my praise for this, perform a part Thou hast not done before. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Well, I must do't: Away, my disposition, and possess me Some harlot's spirit! My throat of war be turn'd, Which quired with my drum, into a pipe Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves Tent in my cheeks; and school-boys' tears take up The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue Make motion through my lips; and my arm'd knees, Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his That hath receiv'd an alms! I will not do't; Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth, And by my body's action teach my mind A most inherent baseness. <br />&nbsp; <br />VOLUMNIA. At thy choice, then: To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour Than thou of them. Come all to ruin: let Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear Thy dangerous stoutness; for I mock at death With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list. Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me; But owe thy pride thyself. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Pray, be content: Mother, I am going to the market-place; Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves, Cog their hearts from them, and come home belov'd Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going. Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul; Or never trust to what my tongue can do I' the way of flattery further. <br />&nbsp; <br />VOLUMNIA. Do your will. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Exit.] <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. Away! The tribunes do attend you: arm yourself To answer mildly; for they are prepar'd With accusations, as I hear, more strong Than are upon you yet. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. The word is, mildly. Pray you let us go: Let them accuse me by invention, I Will answer in mine honour. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Ay, but mildly. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Well, mildly be it then; mildly. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Exeunt.]<br /></span><span id = 14280 >The Forum. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS.] <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. In this point charge him home, that he affects Tyrannical power: if he evade us there, Enforce him with his envy to the people; And that the spoil got on the Antiates Was ne'er distributed. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter an AEDILE.] <br />&nbsp; <br />What, will he come? <br />&nbsp; <br />AEDILE. He's coming. <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. How accompanied? <br />&nbsp; <br />AEDILE. With old Menenius, and those senators That always favour'd him. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Have you a catalogue Of all the voices that we have procur'd, Set down by the poll? <br />&nbsp; <br />AEDILE. I have; 'tis ready. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Have you collected them by tribes? <br />&nbsp; <br />AEDILE. I have. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Assemble presently the people hither: And when they hear me say 'It shall be so I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them, If I say fine, cry 'Fine!'- if death, cry 'Death;' Insisting on the old prerogative And power i' the truth o' the cause. <br />&nbsp; <br />AEDILE. I shall inform them. <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. And when such time they have begun to cry, Let them not cease, but with a din confus'd Enforce the present execution Of what we chance to sentence. <br />&nbsp; <br />AEDILE. Very well. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Make them be strong, and ready for this hint, When we shall hap to give't them. <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. Go about it. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Exit AEDILE.] Put him to choler straight: he hath been us'd Ever to conquer, and to have his worth Of contradiction; being once chaf'd, he cannot Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks What's in his heart; and that is there which looks With us to break his neck. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Well, here he comes. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, COMINIUS, Senators, and Patricians.] <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Calmly, I do beseech you. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece Will bear the knave by the volume. The honoured gods Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice Supplied with worthy men! plant love among's! Throng our large temples with the shows of peace, And not our streets with war! <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST SENATOR. Amen, amen! <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. A noble wish. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Re-enter the AEDILE, with Citizens.] <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Draw near, ye people. <br />&nbsp; <br />AEDILE. List to your tribunes; audience: peace, I say! <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. First, hear me speak. <br />&nbsp; <br />BOTH TRIBUNES. Well, say. Peace, ho! <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Shall I be charg'd no further than this present? Must all determine here? <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. I do demand, If you submit you to the people's voices, Allow their officers, and are content To suffer lawful censure for such faults As shall be proved upon you. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. I am content. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Lo, citizens, he says he is content: The warlike service he has done, consider; think Upon the wounds his body bears, which show Like graves i' the holy churchyard. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Scratches with briers, Scars to move laughter only. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Consider further, That when he speaks not like a citizen, You find him like a soldier: do not take His rougher accents for malicious sounds, But, as I say, such as become a soldier, Rather than envy you. <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. Well, well, no more. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. What is the matter, That being pass'd for consul with full voice, I am so dishonour'd that the very hour You take it off again? <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Answer to us. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Say then: 'tis true, I ought so. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. We charge you that you have contriv'd to take From Rome all season'd office, and to wind Yourself into a power tyrannical; For which you are a traitor to the people. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. How! traitor! <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Nay, temperately; your promise. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. The fires i' the lowest hell fold in the people! Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune! Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths, In thy hands clutch'd as many millions, in Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say, Thou liest unto thee with a voice as free As I do pray the gods. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Mark you this, people? <br />&nbsp; <br />CITIZENS. To the rock, to the rock, with him! <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Peace! We need not put new matter to his charge: What you have seen him do and heard him speak, Beating your officers, cursing yourselves, Opposing laws with strokes, and here defying Those whose great power must try him; even this, So criminal and in such capital kind, Deserves the extremest death. <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. But since he hath Serv'd well for Rome, <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. What do you prate of service? <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. I talk of that that know it. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. You? <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Is this the promise that you made your mother? <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. Know, I pray you, <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. I'll know no further: Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death, Vagabond exile, flaying, pent to linger But with a grain a day, I would not buy Their mercy at the price of one fair word, Nor check my courage for what they can give, To have't with saying Good-morrow. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. For that he has, As much as in him lies, from time to time Envied against the people, seeking means To pluck away their power; as now at last Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers That do distribute it; in the name o' the people, And in the power of us the tribunes, we, Even from this instant, banish him our city, In peril of precipitation From off the rock Tarpeian, never more To enter our Rome gates: I' the people's name, I say it shall be so. <br />&nbsp; <br />CITIZENS. It shall be so, it shall be so; let him away; He's banished, and it shall be so. <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. Hear me, my masters and my common friends, <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. He's sentenc'd; no more hearing. <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. Let me speak: I have been consul, and can show for Rome Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love My country's good with a respect more tender, More holy and profound, than mine own life, My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase, And treasure of my loins; then if I would Speak that, <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. We know your drift. Speak what? <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd, As enemy to the people and his country: It shall be so. <br />&nbsp; <br />CITIZENS. It shall be so, it shall be so. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize As the dead carcasses of unburied men That do corrupt my air, I banish you; And here remain with your uncertainty! Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts! Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes, Fan you into despair! Have the power still To banish your defenders; till at length Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels, Making but reservation of yourselves, Still your own foes, deliver you, as most Abated captives to some nation That won you without blows! Despising, For you, the city, thus I turn my back: There is a world elsewhere. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Exeunt CORIOLANUS, COMINIUS, MENENIUS, Senators, and Patricians.] <br />&nbsp; <br />AEDILE. The people's enemy is gone, is gone! <br />&nbsp; <br />CITIZENS. Our enemy is banish'd, he is gone! Hoo! hoo! <br />&nbsp; <br />[Shouting, and throwing up their caps.] <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Go, see him out at gates, and follow him, As he hath follow'd you, with all despite; Give him deserv'd vexation. Let a guard Attend us through the city. <br />&nbsp; <br />CITIZENS. Come, come, let's see him out at gates; come. The gods preserve our noble tribunes!

Come, leave your tears; a brief farewell: he beast With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother, Where is your ancient courage? you were us'd To say extremities was the trier of spirits; That common chances common men could bear; That when the sea was calm all boats alike Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows, When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves A noble cunning; you were us'd to load me With precepts that would make invincible The heart that conn'd them. <br />&nbsp; <br />VIRGILIA. O heavens! O heavens! <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Nay, I pr'y thee, woman, <br />&nbsp; <br />VOLUMNIA. Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome, And occupations perish! <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. What, what, what! I shall be lov'd when I am lack'd. Nay, mother, Resume that spirit when you were wont to say, If you had been the wife of Hercules, Six of his labours you'd have done, and sav'd Your husband so much sweat. Cominius, Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother: I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius, Thy tears are salter than a younger man's, And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general, I have seen thee stern, and thou hast oft beheld Heart-hard'ning spectacles; tell these sad women 'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes, As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well My hazards still have been your solace: and Believe't not lightly, though I go alone, Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen, your son Will or exceed the common or be caught With cautelous baits and practice.<br />&nbsp; <br />VOLUMNIA. My first son, Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius With thee awhile: determine on some course More than a wild exposture to each chance That starts i' the way before thee. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. O the gods! <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. I'll follow thee a month, devise with thee Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us, And we of thee: so, if the time thrust forth A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send O'er the vast world to seek a single man; And lose advantage, which doth ever cool I' the absence of the needer. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Fare ye well: Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full Of the wars' surfeits to go rove with one That's yet unbruis'd: bring me but out at gate. Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and My friends of noble touch; when I am forth, Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come. While I remain above the ground, you shall Hear from me still; and never of me aught But what is like me formerly. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. That's worthily As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep. If I could shake off but one seven years From these old arms and legs, by the good gods, I'd with thee every foot. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS.

You had more beard when I last saw you; but your favour is well approved by your tongue. What's the news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state, to find you out there; you have well saved me a day's journey. <br />&nbsp; <br />ROMAN. There hath been in Rome strange insurrections: the people against the senators, patricians, and nobles. <br />&nbsp; <br />VOLSCE. Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not so; they are in a most warlike preparation, and hope to come upon them in the heat of their division. <br />&nbsp; <br />ROMAN. The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make it flame again; for the nobles receive so to heart the banishment of that worthy Coriolanus that they are in a ripe aptness to take all power from the people, and to pluck from them their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can tell you, and is almost mature for the violent breaking out. <br />&nbsp; <br />VOLSCE. Coriolanus banished! <br />&nbsp; <br />ROMAN. Banished, sir. <br />&nbsp; <br />VOLSCE. You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor. <br />&nbsp; <br />ROMAN. The day serves well for them now. I have heard it said the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is when she's fallen out with her husband. Your noble Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request of his country. <br />&nbsp; <br />VOLSCE. He cannot choose. I am most fortunate thus accidentally to encounter you; you have ended my business, and I will merrily accompany you home. <br />&nbsp; <br />ROMAN. I shall between this and supper tell you most strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you? <br />&nbsp; <br />VOLSCE. A most royal one; the centurions and their charges, distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment, and to be on foot at an hour's warning. <br />&nbsp; <br />ROMAN. I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the man, I think, that shall set them in present action. So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company. <br />&nbsp; <br />VOLSCE.

Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones, In puny battle slay me. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter a CITIZEN.] <br />&nbsp; <br />Save you, sir. <br />&nbsp; <br />CITIZEN. And you. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Direct me, if it be your will, Wheregreat Aufidius lies; is he in Antium? <br />&nbsp; <br />CITIZEN. He is, and feasts the nobles of the state At his house this night. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Which is his house, beseech you? <br />&nbsp; <br />CITIZEN. This, here, before you. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Thank you, sir; farewell. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Exit CITIZEN.] <br />&nbsp; <br />O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn, Whose double bosoms seems to wear one heart, Whose hours, whose bed, whose meal and exercise Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love Unseparable, shall within this hour, On a dissension of a do it, break out To bitterest enmity; so fellest foes, Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep To take the one the other, by some chance, Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends And inter join their issues. So with me: My birthplaces hate I, and my love's upon This enemy town. I'll enter; if he slay me, He does fair justice; if he give me way, I'll do his country service.<br /></span><span id = 14287 >Antium. A hall in AUFIDIUS'S house. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Music within. Enter A SERVANT.] <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST SERVANT. Wine, wine, wine! What service is here! I think our fellows are asleep. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Exit.] <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter a second SERVANT.] <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND SERVANT. Where's Cotus? my master calls for him. Cotus!&nbsp;&nbsp; [Exit.] <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter CORIOLANUS.] <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. A goodly house: the feast smells well; but I Appear not like a guest. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Re-enter the first SERVANT.] <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST SERVANT. What would you have, friend? whence are you? Here's no place for you: pray go to the door. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. I have deserv'd no better entertainment In being Coriolanus. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Re-enter second SERVANT.] <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND SERVANT. Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his head that he gives entrance to such companions? Pray, get you out. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Away! <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND SERVANT. Away? Get you away. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Now the art troublesome. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND SERVANT. Are you so brave? I'll have you talked with anon. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter a third SERVANT. The first meets him.] <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD SERVANT. What fellow's this? <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST SERVANT. A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get him out o' the house. Pr'ythee call my master to him. <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD SERVANT. What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you avoid the house. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth. <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD SERVANT. What are you? <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. A gentleman. <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD SERVANT. A marvellous poor one. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. True, so I am. <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD SERVANT. Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other station; here's no place for you. Pray you avoid; come. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Follow your function, go, And batten on cold bits. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Pushes him away.] <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD SERVANT. What, you will not? Pr'y thee, tell my master what a strange guest he has here. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND SERVANT. And I shall. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Exit.]&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD SERVANT. Where dwell'st thou? <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Under the canopy. <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD SERVANT. Under the canopy? <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Ay. <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD SERVANT. Where's that? <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. I' the city of kites and crows. <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD SERVANT. I' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is! Then thou dwell'st with daws too? <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. No, I serve not thy master. <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD SERVANT. How, sir! Do you meddle with my master? <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy mistress. Thou prat'st and prat'st; serve with thy trencher, hence! <br />&nbsp; <br />[Beats him away.] <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter AUFIDIUS and the second SERVANT.] <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. Where is this fellow? <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND SERVANT. Here, sir; I'd have beaten him like a dog, but for disturbing the lords within. <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. Whence com'st thou? what wouldst thou? thy name? Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name? <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. [Unmuffling.] If, Tullus, Not yet thou know'st me, and, seeing me, dost not Think me for the man I am, necessity Commands me name myself. <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. What is thy name? <br />&nbsp; <br />[Servants retire.] <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears, And harsh in sound to thine. <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. Say, what's thy name? Thou has a grim appearance, and thy face Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn, Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name? <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st thou me yet? <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. I know thee not: thy name? <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done To thee particularly, and to all the Volsces, Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service, The extreme dangers, and the drops of blood Shed for my thankless country, are requited But with that surname; a good memory, And witness of the malice and displeasure Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains; The cruelty and envy of the people, Permitted by our dastard nobles, who Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest, And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be Whoop'd out of Rome. Now, this extremity Hath brought me to thy hearth: not out of hope, Mistake me not, to save my life; for if I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world I would have 'voided thee; but in mere spite, To be full quit of those my banishers, Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge Thine own particular wrongs, and stop those maims Of shame seen through thy country, speed thee straight And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it That my revengeful services may prove As benefits to thee; for I will fight Against my canker'd country with the spleen Of all the under fiends. But if so be Thou dar'st not this, and that to prove more fortunes Th'art tir'd, then, in a word, I also am Longer to live most weary, and present My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice; Which not to cut would show thee but a fool, Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate, Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast, And cannot live but to thy shame, unless It be to do thee service. <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. O Marcius, Marcius! Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter Should from yond cloud speak divine things, And say 'Tis true,' I'd not believe them more Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine Mine arms about that body, where against My grained ash an hundred times hath broke And scar'd the moon with splinters; here I clip The anvil of my sword, and do contest As hotly and as nobly with thy love As ever in ambitious strength I did Contend against thy valour. Know thou first, I lov'd the maid I married; never man Sighed truer breath; but that I see thee here, Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart Than when I first my wedded mistress saw Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee We have a power on foot; and I had purpose Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn, Or lose mine arm for't: thou hast beat me out Twelve several times, and I have nightly since Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me; We have been down together in my sleep, Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat, And wak'd half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius, Had we no other quarrel else to Rome, but that Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all From twelve to seventy; and, pouring war Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome, Like a bold flood o'erbear. O, come, go in, And take our friendly senators by the hands; Who now are here, taking their leaves of me, Who am prepar'd against your territories, Though not for Rome itself. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. You bless me, gods! <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have The leading of thine own revenges, take Th' one half of my commission; and set down, As best thou art experienc'd, since thou know'st Thy country's strength and weakness, thine own ways; Whether to knock against the gates of Rome, Or rudely visit them in parts remote, To fright them, ere destroy. But come in; Let me commend thee first to those that shall Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes! And more a friend than e'er an enemy; Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome! <br />&nbsp; <br />[Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS.] <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; FIRST SERVANT. Here's a strange alteration! <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND SERVANT. By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report of him. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST SERVANT. What an arm he has! He turned me about with his finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND SERVANT. Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in him; he had, sir, a kind of face, me thought, I cannot tell how to term it. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST SERVANT. He had so, looking as it were, would I were hanged, but I thought there was more in him than I could think. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND SERVANT. So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest man i' the world. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST SERVANT. I think he is; but a greater soldier than he you wot on. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND SERVANT. Who, my master? <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST SERVANT. Nay, it's no matter for that. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND SERVANT. Worth six on him. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST SERVANT. Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the greater soldier. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND SERVANT. Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that: for the defence of a town our general is excellent. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST SERVANT. Ay, and for an assault too. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Re-enter third SERVANT.] <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD SERVANT. O slaves, I can tell you news, news, you rascals! <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST and SECOND SERVANT. What, what, what? let's partake. <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD SERVANT. I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as lief be a condemned man. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST and SECOND SERVANT. Wherefore? wherefore? <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD SERVANT. Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general, Caius Marcius. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST SERVANT. Why do you say, thwack our general? <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD SERVANT. I do not say thwack our general; but he was always good enough for him. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND SERVANT. Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too hard for him; I have heard him say so himself. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST SERVANT. He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth on't; before Corioli he scotched him and notched him like a carbonado. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND SERVANT. An he had been cannibally given, he might have broiled and eaten him too. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST SERVANT. But more of thy news? <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD SERVANT. Why, he is so made on here within as if he were son and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table: no question asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him: our general himself makes a mistress of him, sanctifies himself with's hand, and turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But the bottom of the news is, our general is cut i' the middle, and but one half of what he was yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says, and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears; he will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND SERVANT. And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine. <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD SERVANT. Do't! he will do't; for look you, sir, he has as many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as we term it, his friends, whilst he's in dejectitude. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST SERVANT. Dejectitude! what's that? <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD SERVANT. But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again, and the man in blood, they will out of their burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with him. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST SERVANT. But when goes this forward? <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD SERVANT. To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis as it were parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they wipe their lips. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND SERVANT. Why, then we shall have a stirring world again. This peace is nothing but to rust iron, increase tailors, and breed ballad-makers. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST SERVANT. Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy; mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more bastard children than war's a destroyer of men. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND SERVANT. 'Tis so: and as war in some sort, may be said to be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckolds. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST SERVANT. Ay, and it makes men hate one another. <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD SERVANT. Reason: because they then less need one another. The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising. <br />&nbsp; <br />ALL. In, in, in, in! <br />&nbsp; <br />[Exeunt.]<br /></span><span id = 14288 >Rome.

We hear not of him, neither need we fear him; His remedies are tame i' the present peace And quietness of the people, which before Were in wild hurry. Here do make his friends Blush that the world goes well; who rather had, Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see Our tradesmen singing in their shops, and going About their functions friendly. <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. We stood to't in good time. Is this Menenius? <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. 'Tis he, 'tis he. O, he is grown most kind Of late. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter MENENIUS <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. Hail, sir! <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Hail to you both! <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Your Coriolanus is not much miss'd But with his friends: the commonwealth doth stand; And so would do, were he more angry at it. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. All's well, and might have been much better if He could have temporiz'd. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Where is he, hear you? <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife Hear nothing from him. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter three or four Citizens.] <br />&nbsp; <br />CITIZENS.

Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees, Are bound to pray for you both. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Live and thrive! <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus Had lov'd you as we did. <br />&nbsp; <br />CITIZENS. Now the gods keep you! <br />&nbsp; <br />BOTH TRIBUNES. Farewell, farewell. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Exeunt Citizens.] <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. This is a happier and more comely time Than when these fellows ran about the streets Crying confusion. <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. Caius Marcius was A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent, O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking, Self-loving, <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. And affecting one sole throne, Without assistance. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. I think not so. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. We should by this, to all our lamentation, If he had gone forth consul, found it so. <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. The gods have well prevented it, and Rome Sits safe and still without him. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter an AEDILE.] <br />&nbsp; <br />AEDILE. Worthy tribunes, There is a slave, whom we have put in prison, Reports, the Volsces with several powers Are enter'd in the Roman territories, And with the deepest malice of the war Destroy what lies before 'em. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. 'Tis Aufidius, Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment, Thrusts forth his horns again into the world; Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome, And durst not once peep out. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Come, what talk you of Marcius? <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be The Volsces dare break with us. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Cannot be! We have record that very well it can; And three examples of the like hath been Within my age. But reason with the fellow, Before you punish him, where he heard this; Lest you shall chance to whip your information And beat the messenger who bids beware Of what is to be dreaded. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Tell not me: I know this cannot be. <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. Not possible. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter A MESSENGER.] <br />&nbsp; <br />MESSENGER. The nobles in great earnestness are going All to the senate-house: some news is come That turns their countenances. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. 'Tis this slave, Go whip him fore the people's eyes: his raising; Nothing but his report. <br />&nbsp; <br />MESSENGER. Yes, worthy sir, The slave's report is seconded, and more, More fearful, is deliver'd. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. What more fearful? <br />&nbsp; <br />MESSENGER. It is spoke freely out of many mouths, How probable I do not know, that Marcius, Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome, And vows revenge as spacious as between The young'st and oldest thing. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. This is most likely! <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. Rais'd only, that the weaker sort may wish Good Marcius home again. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. The very trick on 't. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. This is unlikely: He and Aufidius can no more atone Than violentest contrariety. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter a second MESSENGER.] <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND MESSENGER. You are sent for to the senate: A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius Associated with Aufidius, rages Upon our territories; and have already O'erborne their way, consum'd with fire and took What lay before them. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter COMINIUS.] <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. O, you have made good work! <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. What news? what news? <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. You have holp to ravish your own daughters, and To melt the city leads upon your pates; To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses, <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. What's the news? what's the news? <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. Your temples burned in their cement; and Your franchises, whereon you stood, confin'd Into an auger's bore. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Pray now, your news? You have made fair work, I fear me. Pray, your news. If Marcius should be join'd wi' the Volscians, <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. If! He is their god: he leads them like a thing Made by some other deity than nature, That shapes man better; and they follow him, Against us brats, with no less confidence Than boys pursuing summer butterflies, Or butchers killing flies. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. You have made good work, You and your apron men; you that stood so much Upon the voice of occupation and The breath of garlic-eaters! <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. He'll shake Your Rome about your ears. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. As Hercules Did shake down mellow fruit. You have made fair work! <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. But is this true, sir? <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. Ay; and you'll look pale Before you find it other. All the regions Do smilingly revolt; and who resists Are mock'd for valiant ignorance, And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him? Your enemies and his find something in him. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. We are all undone unless The noble man have mercy. <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. Who shall ask it? The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people Deserve such pity of him as the wolf Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charg'd him even As those should do that had deserv'd his hate, And therein show'd like enemies. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. 'Tis true: If he were putting to my house the brand That should consume it, I have not the face To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands, You and your crafts! You have crafted fair! <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. You have brought A trembling upon Rome, such as was never So incapable of help. <br />&nbsp; <br />BOTH TRIBUNES. Say not, we brought it. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. How! Was it we? we lov'd him, but, like beasts, And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters, Who did hoot him out o' the city. <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. But I fear They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius, The second name of men, obeys his points As if he were his officer: desperation Is all the policy, strength, and defence, That Rome can make against them. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter a troop of citizens.] <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Here comes the clusters. And is Aufidius with him? You are they That made the air unwholesome, when you cast Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming; And not a hair upon a soldier's head Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs As you threw caps up will he tumble down, And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter; If he could burn us all into one coal We have deserv'd it. <br />&nbsp; <br />CITIZENS. Faith, we hear fearful news. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST CITIZEN. For mine own part, When I said banish him, I said 'twas pity. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND CITIZEN. And so did I. <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD CITIZEN. And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very many of us. That we did, we did for the best; and though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet it was against our will. <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. You are goodly things, you voices! <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. You have made Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol? <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. O, ay; what else?

Worthy tribunes, There is a slave, whom we have put in prison, Reports, the Volsces with several powers Are enter'd in the Roman territories, And with the deepest malice of the war Destroy what lies before 'em. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. 'Tis Aufidius, Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment, Thrusts forth his horns again into the world; Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome, And durst not once peep out. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Come, what talk you of Marcius? <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be The Volsces dare break with us. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Cannot be! We have record that very well it can; And three examples of the like hath been Within my age. But reason with the fellow, Before you punish him, where he heard this; Lest you shall chance to whip your information And beat the messenger who bids beware Of what is to be dreaded. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Tell not me: I know this cannot be. <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. Not possible. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter A MESSENGER.] <br />&nbsp; <br />MESSENGER. The nobles in great earnestness are going All to the senate-house: some news is come That turns their countenances. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. 'Tis this slave, Go whip him fore the people's eyes: his raising; Nothing but his report. <br />&nbsp; <br />MESSENGER. Yes, worthy sir, The slave's report is seconded, and more, More fearful, is deliver'd. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. What more fearful? <br />&nbsp; <br />MESSENGER. It is spoke freely out of many mouths, How probable I do not know, that Marcius, Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome, And vows revenge as spacious as between The young'st and oldest thing. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. This is most likely! <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. Rais'd only, that the weaker sort may wish Good Marcius home again. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. The very trick on 't. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. This is unlikely: He and Aufidius can no more atone Than violentest contrariety. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter a second MESSENGER.] <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND MESSENGER. You are sent for to the senate: A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius Associated with Aufidius, rages Upon our territories; and have already O'erborne their way, consum'd with fire and took What lay before them. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter COMINIUS.] <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. O, you have made good work! <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. What news? what news? <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. You have holp to ravish your own daughters, and To melt the city leads upon your pates; To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses, <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. What's the news? what's the news? <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. Your temples burned in their cement; and Your franchises, whereon you stood, confin'd Into an auger's bore. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Pray now, your news? You have made fair work, I fear me. Pray, your news. If Marcius should be join'd wi' the Volscians, <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. If! He is their god: he leads them like a thing Made by some other deity than nature, That shapes man better; and they follow him, Against us brats, with no less confidence Than boys pursuing summer butterflies, Or butchers killing flies. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. You have made good work, You and your apron men; you that stood so much Upon the voice of occupation and The breath of garlic-eaters! <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. He'll shake Your Rome about your ears. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. As Hercules Did shake down mellow fruit. You have made fair work! <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. But is this true, sir? <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. Ay; and you'll look pale Before you find it other. All the regions Do smilingly revolt; and who resists Are mock'd for valiant ignorance, And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him? Your enemies and his find something in him. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. We are all undone unless The noble man have mercy. <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. Who shall ask it? The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people Deserve such pity of him as the wolf Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charg'd him even As those should do that had deserv'd his hate, And therein show'd like enemies. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. 'Tis true: If he were putting to my house the brand That should consume it, I have not the face To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands, You and your crafts! You have crafted fair! <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. You have brought A trembling upon Rome, such as was never So incapable of help. <br />&nbsp; <br />BOTH TRIBUNES. Say not, we brought it. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. How! Was it we? we lov'd him, but, like beasts, And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters, Who did hoot him out o' the city. <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. But I fear They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius, The second name of men, obeys his points As if he were his officer: desperation Is all the policy, strength, and defence, That Rome can make against them. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter a troop of citizens.] <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Here comes the clusters. And is Aufidius with him? You are they That made the air unwholesome, when you cast Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming; And not a hair upon a soldier's head Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs As you threw caps up will he tumble down, And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter; If he could burn us all into one coal We have deserv'd it. <br />&nbsp; <br />CITIZENS. Faith, we hear fearful news. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST CITIZEN. For mine own part, When I said banish him, I said 'twas pity. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND CITIZEN. And so did I. <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD CITIZEN. And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very many of us. That we did, we did for the best; and though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet it was against our will. <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. You are goodly things, you voices! <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. You have made Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol? <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. O, ay; what else? [Exeunt COMINIUS and MENENIUS.] <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd; These are a side that would be glad to have This true which they so seem to fear. Go home, And show no sign of fear. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST CITIZEN. The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home. I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished him. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND CITIZEN. So did we all. But come, let's home. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Exeunt Citizens.] <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. I do not like this news. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Nor I. <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. Let's to the Capitol: would half my wealth Would buy this for a lie! <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS.

A public place <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter MENENIUS, COMINIUS, SICINIUS and BRUTUS, and others.] <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said Which was sometime his general; who lov'd him In a most dear particular. He call'd me father: But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him; A mile before his tent fall down, and knee The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home. <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. He would not seem to know me. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Do you hear? <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. Yet one time he did call me by my name: I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops That we have bled together. Coriolanus He would not answer to: forbad all names; He was a kind of nothing, titleless, Till he had forg'd himself a name i' the fire Of burning Rome. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Why, so! you have made good work! A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome, To make coals cheap, a noble memory! <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon When it was less expected: he replied, It was a bare petition of a state To one whom they had punish'd. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Very well: Could he say less? <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. I offer'd to awaken his regard For's private friends: his answer to me was, He could not stay to pick them in a pile Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly, For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt And still to nose the offence. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. For one poor grain Or two! I am one of those; his mother, wife, His child, and this brave fellow too- we are the grains: You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt Above the moon: we must be burnt for you. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Nay, pray be patient: if you refuse your aid In this so never-needed help, yet do not Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue, More than the instant army we can make, Might stop our countryman. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. No; I'll not meddle. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Pray you, go to him. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. What should I do? <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. Only make trial what your love can do For Rome, towards Marcius. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Well, and say that Marcius Return me, as Cominius is return'd, Unheard; what then? But as a discontented friend, grief-shot With his unkindness? Say't be so? <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Yet your good-will Must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure As you intended well. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. I'll undertake't; I think he'll hear me. Yet to bite his lip And hum at good Cominius much unhearts me. He was not taken well: he had not din'd; The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then We pout upon the morning, are unapt To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd These pipes and these conveyances of our blood With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls Than in our priest-like fasts. Therefore I'll watch him Till he be dieted to my request, And then I'll set upon him. <br />&nbsp; <br />BRUTUS. You know the very road into his kindness And cannot lose your way. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Good faith, I'll prove him, Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge Of my success. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Exit.] <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. He'll never hear him. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Not? <br />&nbsp; <br />COMINIUS. I tell you he does sit in gold, his eye Red as 'twould burn Rome: and his injury The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him; 'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise'; dismissed me Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do, He sent in writing after me; what he would not, Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions: So that all hope is vain, Unless his noble mother and his wife; Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him For mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence, And with our fair entreaties haste them on. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Exeunt.]<br /></span><span id = 14292 >An Advanced post of the Volscian camp before Rome.

Stand, and go back. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave, I am an officer of state, and come To speak with Coriolanus. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST GUARD. From whence? <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. From Rome. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST GUARD. You may not pass; you must return: our general Will no more hear from thence. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND GUARD. You'll see your Rome embrac'd with fire before You'll speak with Coriolanus. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Good my friends, If you have heard your general talk of Rome And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks My name hath touch'd your ears: it is Menenius. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST GUARD. Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name Is not here passable. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. I tell thee, fellow, Thy general is my lover: I have been The book of his good acts, whence men have read His fame unparallel'd, haply amplified; For I have ever verified my friends, Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes, Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground, I have tumbled past the throw: and in his praise Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow, I must have leave to pass. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST GUARD. Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you should not pass here: no, though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Pr'ythee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius, always factionary on the party of your general. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND GUARD. Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you have, I am one that, telling true under him, must say you cannot pass. Therefore go back. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Has he dined, canst thou tell? For I would not speak with him till after dinner. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST GUARD. You are a Roman, are you? <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. I am as thy general is. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST GUARD. Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you, when you have pushed out your gates the very defender of them, and in a violent popular ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived; therefore back to Rome, and prepare for your execution: you are condemned; our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here he would use me with estimation. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND GUARD. Come, my captain knows you not. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. I mean thy general. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST GUARD. My general cares not for you. Back, I say; go, lest I let forth your half pint of blood; back; that's the utmost of your having: back. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Nay, but fellow, fellow, <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter CORIOLANUS with AUFIDIUS.] <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. What's the matter? <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you; you shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall perceive that a jack guardant cannot office me from my son Coriolanus: guess but by my entertainment with him if thou standest not i' the state of hanging, or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueller in suffering; behold now presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee. The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than thy old father Menenius does! O my son! my son! thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to thee; but being assured none but myself could move thee, I have been blown out of your gates with sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome and thy petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here; this, who, like a block, hath denied my access to thee. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Away! <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. How! away! <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs Are servanted to others: though I owe My revenge properly, my remission lies In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar, Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather Than pity note how much. Therefore be gone. Mine ears against your suits are stronger than Your gates against my force. Yet, for I lov'd thee, Take this along; I writ it for thy sake, <br />&nbsp; <br />[Gives a letter.] <br />&nbsp; <br />And would have sent it. Another word, Menenius, I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius, Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st! <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. You keep a constant temper. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS.] <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST GUARD. Now, sir, is your name Menenius? <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND GUARD. 'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the way home again. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST GUARD. Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your greatness back? <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND GUARD. What cause, do you think, I have to swoon? <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. I neither care for the world nor your general; for such things as you, I can scarce think there's any, y'are so slight. He that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another. Let your general do his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and your misery increase with your age! I say to you, as I was said to, away!&nbsp;&nbsp; [Exit.] <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST GUARD. A noble fellow, I warrant him. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND GUARD.

Only their ends You have respected; stopped your ears against The general suit of Rome; never admitted A private whisper, no, not with such friends That thought them sure of you. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. This last old man, Whom with crack'd heart I have sent to Rome, Lov'd me above the measure of a father; Nay, godded me indeed. Their latest refuge Was to send him; for whose old love I have, Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd The first conditions, which they did refuse, And cannot now accept, to grace him only, That thought he could do more, a very little I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits, Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter Will I lend ear to. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Shout within.] <br />&nbsp; <br />Ha! what shout is this? Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow In the same time 'tis made? I will not. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter, in mourning habits, VIRGILIA, VOLUMNIA, leading YOUNG MARCIUS, VALERIA, and attendants.] <br />&nbsp; <br />My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould Wherein this trunk was fram'd, and in her hand The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection! All bond and privilege of nature, break! Let it be virtuous to be obstinate. What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes, Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows, As if Olympus to a molehill should In supplication nod: and my young boy Hath an aspect of intercession which Great nature cries "Deny not.' Let the Volsces Plough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never Be such a gosling to obey instinct; but stand, As if a man were author of himself, And knew no other kin. <br />&nbsp; <br />VIRGILIA.

This is a poor epitome of yours, Which, by the interpretation of full time, May show like all yourself. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS.

I beseech you, peace: Or, if you'd ask, remember this before, The thing I have forsworn to grant may never Be held by you denials. Do not bid me Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate Again with Rome's mechanics. Tell me not Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not To allay my rages and revenges with Your colder reasons. <br />&nbsp; <br />VOLUMNIA. O, no more, no more! You have said you will not grant us anything; For we have nothing else to ask but that Which you deny already: yet we will ask; That, if you fail in our request, the blame May hang upon your hardness; therefore hear us. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark: for we'll Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request? <br />&nbsp; <br />VOLUMNIA. Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment And state of bodies would bewray what life We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself, How more unfortunate than all living women Are we come hither: since that thy sight, which should Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts, Constrains them weep, and shake with fear and sorrow; Making the mother, wife, and child, to see The son, the husband, and the father, tearing His country's bowels out. And to poor we, Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort That all but we enjoy; for how can we, Alas, how can we for our country pray, Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory, Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person, Our comfort in the country. We must find An evident calamity, though we had Our wish, which side should win; for either thou Must, as a foreign recreant, be led With manacles through our streets, or else Triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin, And bear the palm for having bravely shed Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son, I purpose not to wait on fortune till These wars determine: if I can not persuade thee Rather to show a noble grace to both parts Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner March to assault thy country than to tread, Trust to't, thou shalt not, on thy mother's womb That brought thee to this world. <br />&nbsp; <br />VIRGILIA. Ay, and mine, That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name Living to time. <br />&nbsp; <br />BOY. 'A shall not tread on me; I'll run away till I am bigger; but then I'll fight. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Not of a woman's tenderness to be, Requires nor child nor woman's face to see. I have sat too long. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Rising.] <br />&nbsp; <br />VOLUMNIA. Nay, go not from us thus. If it were so that our request did tend To save the Romans, thereby to destroy The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us, As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces May say 'This mercy we have show'd,' the Romans 'This we receiv'd,' and each in either side Give the all-hail to thee, and cry, 'Be bless'd For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son, The end of war's uncertain; but this certain, That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses; Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble, But with his last attempt he wip'd it out; Destroy'd his country, and his name remains To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son: Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour, To imitate the graces of the gods, To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air, And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak? Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you: He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy: Perhaps thy childishness will move him more Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world More bound to's mother; yet here he lets me prate Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy; When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood, Has cluck'd thee to the wars, and safely home, Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust, And spurn me back: but if it be not so, Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee, That thou restrain'st from me the duty which To a mother's part belongs. He turns away: Down, ladies: let us shame him with our knees. To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end; This is the last. So we will home to Rome, And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold's: This boy, that cannot tell what he would have But kneels and holds up hands for fellowship, Does reason our petition with more strength Than thou hast to deny't. Come, let us go: This fellow had a Volscian to his mother; His wife is in Corioli, and his child Like him by chance. Yet give us our despatch: I am hush'd until our city be afire, And then I'll speak a little. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. [After holding VOLUMNIA by the hands, in silence.] O mother, mother! What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope, The gods look down, and this unnatural scene They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O! You have won a happy victory to Rome; But for your son, believe it, O, believe it, Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd, If not most mortal to him. But let it come. Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars, I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius, Were you in my stead, would you have heard A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius? <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. I was mov'd withal. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. I dare be sworn you were: And, sir, it is no little thing to make Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir, What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part, I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and, pray you Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife! <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. [Aside.] I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy honour At difference in thee; out of that I'll work Myself a former fortune. <br />&nbsp; <br />[The Ladies make signs to CORIOLANUS.] <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. [To VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, &amp;c.] Ay, by and by; But we'll drink together; and you shall bear A better witness back than words, which we, On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd. Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve To have a temple built you: all the swords In Italy, and her confederate arms, Could not have made this peace. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Exeunt.]<br /></span><span id = 14294 >Rome.

Why, what of that? <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. If it be possible for you to displace it with your little finger, there is some hope the ladies of Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him. But I say there is no hope in't: our throats are sentenced, and stay upon execution. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Is't possible that so short a time can alter the condition of a man? <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. There is differency between a grub and a butterfly; yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown from man to dragon; he has wings; he's more than a creeping thing. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. He loved his mother dearly. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with his eye, talks like a knell, and his hum is a battery. He sits in his state as a thing made for Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity, and a heaven to throne in. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. Yes, mercy, if you report him truly. <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his mother shall bring from him. There is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that shall our poor city find: and all this is 'long of you. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS. The gods be good unto us! <br />&nbsp; <br />MENENIUS. No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto us. When we banished him we respected not them; and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter a MESSENGER <br />&nbsp; <br />MESSENGER.

What's the news? <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND MESSENGER. Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd, The Volscians are dislodg'd, and Marcius gone: A merrier day did never yet greet Rome, No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins. <br />&nbsp; <br />SICINIUS.

A public place. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS, with attendants.] <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. Go tell the lords o' the city I am here: Deliver them this paper; having read it, Bid them repair to the market-place: where I, Even in theirs and in the commons' ears, Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse The city ports by this hath enter'd and Intends t' appear before the people, hoping To purge himself with words: despatch. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Exeunt attendants.] <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter three or four CONSPIRATORS of AUFIDIUS' faction.] <br />&nbsp; <br />Most welcome! <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST CONSPIRATOR. How is it with our general? <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. Even so As with a man by his own alms empoison'd, And with his charity slain. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND CONSPIRATOR. Most noble sir, If you do hold the same intent wherein You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you Of your great danger. <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. Sir, I cannot tell: We must proceed as we do find the people. <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD CONSPIRATOR. The people will remain uncertain whilst 'Twixt you there's difference: but the fall of either Makes the survivor heir of all. <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. I know it; And my pretext to strike at him admits A good construction. I rais'd him, and I pawn'd Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd, He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery, Seducing so my friends; and to this end He bow'd his nature, never known before But to be rough, unswayable, and free. <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD CONSPIRATOR. Sir, his stoutness When he did stand for consul, which he lost By lack of stooping, <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. That I would have spoken of: Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth; Presented to my knife his throat: I took him; Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way In all his own desires; nay, let him choose Out of my files, his projects to accomplish, My best and freshest men; serv'd his designments In mine own person; holp to reap the fame Which he made all his; and took some pride To do myself this wrong: till, at the last, I seem'd his follower, not partner; and He wag'd me with his countenance as if I had been mercenary. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST CONSPIRATOR. So he did, my lord: The army marvell'd at it; and, in the last, When he had carried Rome, and that we look'd For no less spoil than glory, <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. There was it; For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him. At a few drops of women's rheum, which are As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour Of our great action: therefore shall he die, And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark! <br />&nbsp; <br />[Drums and trumpets sound, with great shouts of the people.] <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST CONSPIRATOR. Your native town you enter'd like a post, And had no welcomes home; but he returns Splitting the air with noise. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND CONSPIRATOR. And patient fools, Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear With giving him glory. <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD CONSPIRATOR. Therefore, at your vantage, Ere he express himself or move the people With what he would say, let him feel your sword, Which we will second. When he lies along, After your way his tale pronounc'd shall bury His reasons with his body. <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. Say no more: Here come the lords. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter the LORDS of the city.] <br />&nbsp; <br />LORDS. You are most welcome home. <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. I have not deserv'd it. But, worthy lords, have you with heed perus'd What I have written to you? <br />&nbsp; <br />LORDS. We have. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST LORD. And grieve to hear't. What faults he made before the last, I think Might have found easy fines: but there to end Where he was to begin, and give away The benefit of our levies, answering us With our own charge: making a treaty where There was a yielding. This admits no excuse. <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. He approaches: you shall hear him. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Enter CORIOLANUS, with drum and colours; a crowd of Citizens with him.] <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier; No more infected with my country's love Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting Under your great command. You are to know That prosperously I have attempted, and With bloody passage led your wars even to The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home Do more than counterpoise a full third part The charges of the action. We have made peace With no less honour to the Antiates Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver, Subscribed by the consuls and patricians, Together with the seal o' the senate, what We have compounded on. <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. Read it not, noble lords; But tell the traitor, in the highest degree He hath abus'd your powers. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Traitor! How now? <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. Ay, traitor, Marcius. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Marcius! <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius! Dost thou think I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name Coriolanus, in Corioli? You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously He has betray'd your business, and given up, For certain drops of salt, your city Rome, I say your city, to his wife and mother; Breaking his oath and resolution, like A twist of rotten silk; never admitting Counsel o' the war; but at his nurse's tears He whin'd and roar'd away your victory; That pages blush'd at him, and men of heart Look'd wondering each at others. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Hear'st thou, Mars? <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. Name not the god, thou boy of tears, <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Ha! <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. No more. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave! Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever I was forc'd to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords, Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion, Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that must bear My beating to his grave, shall join to thrust The lie unto him. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST LORD. Peace, both, and hear me speak. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads, Stain all your edges on me. Boy! False hound! If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there, That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli: Alone I did it. Boy! <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. Why, noble lords, Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune, Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart, 'Fore your own eyes and ears? <br />&nbsp; <br />CONSPIRATORS. Let him die for't. <br />&nbsp; <br />CITIZENS. Tear him to pieces, do it presently: he killed my son; my daughter; he killed my cousin Marcus; he killed my father, <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND LORD. Peace, ho! no outrage; peace! The man is noble, and his fame folds in This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius, And trouble not the peace. <br />&nbsp; <br />CORIOLANUS. O that I had him, With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe, To use my lawful sword! <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. Insolent villain! <br />&nbsp; <br />CONSPIRATORS. Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him! <br />&nbsp; <br />[AUFIDIUS and the CONSPIRATORS draw, and kill CORIOLANUS, who falls. AUFIDIUS stands on him.] <br />&nbsp; <br />LORDS. Hold, hold, hold, hold! <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. My noble masters, hear me speak. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST LORD. O Tullus, <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND LORD. Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep. <br />&nbsp; <br />THIRD LORD. Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet; Put up your swords. <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. My lords, when you shall know, as in this rage, Provok'd by him, you cannot, the great danger Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours To call me to your senate, I'll deliver Myself your loyal servant, or endure Your heaviest censure. <br />&nbsp; <br />FIRST LORD. Bear from hence his body, And mourn you for him. Let him be regarded As the most noble corse that ever herald Did follow to his um. <br />&nbsp; <br />SECOND LORD. His own impatience Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame. Let's make the best of it. <br />&nbsp; <br />AUFIDIUS. My rage is gone; And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up: Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one. Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully; Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one, Which to this hour bewail the injury, Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist. <br />&nbsp; <br />[Exeunt, bearing the body of CORIOLANUS. A dead march sounded.]<br /></span>
