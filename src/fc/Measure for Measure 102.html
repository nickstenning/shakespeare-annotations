Thyself and thy belongings<br />Are not thine own so proper as to waste<br />Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.<br />Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,<br />Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues<br />Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike<br />As if we had them not.

There's not a soldier of us all, that, in<br />the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition<br />well that prays for peace.</p><p>Second Gentleman <br />I never heard any soldier dislike it.</p><p>LUCIO <br />I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where<br />grace was said.</p><p>Second Gentleman <br />No? a dozen times at least.</p><p>First Gentleman <br />What, in metre?</p><p>LUCIO <br />In any proportion or in any language.</p><p>First Gentleman <br />I think, or in any religion.</p><p>LUCIO <br />Ay, why not?

Do I speak<br />feelingly now?</p><p>LUCIO <br />I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful<br />feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own<br />confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I<br />live, forget to drink after thee.</p><p>First Gentleman <br />I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?</p><p>Second Gentleman <br />Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.</p><p>LUCIO <br />Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes!

You have<br />not heard of the proclamation, have you?</p><p>MISTRESS OVERDONE <br />What proclamation, man?</p><p>POMPEY <br />All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.</p><p>MISTRESS OVERDONE <br />And what shall become of those in the city?</p><p>POMPEY <br />They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,<br />but that a wise burgher put in for them.</p><p>MISTRESS OVERDONE <br />But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be<br />pulled down?</p><p>POMPEY <br />To the ground, mistress.</p><p>MISTRESS OVERDONE <br />Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!<br />What shall become of me?</p><p>POMPEY <br />Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no<br />clients: though you change your place, you need not<br />change your trade; I'll be your tapster still.<br />Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that<br />have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you<br />will be considered.</p><p>MISTRESS OVERDONE <br />What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.</p><p>POMPEY <br />Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to<br />prison; and there's Madam Juliet.</p><p>Exeunt</p><p>Enter Provost, CLAUDIO, JULIET, and Officers</p><p>CLAUDIO <br />Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?<br />Bear me to prison, where I am committed.</p><p>Provost <br />I do it not in evil disposition,<br />But from Lord Angelo by special charge.</p><p>CLAUDIO <br />Thus can the demigod Authority<br />Make us pay down for our offence by weight<br />The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;<br />On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.</p><p>Re-enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen</p><p>LUCIO <br />Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?</p><p>CLAUDIO <br />From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:<br />As surfeit is the father of much fast,<br />So every scope by the immoderate use<br />Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,<br />Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,<br />A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.</p><p>LUCIO <br />If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would<br />send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say<br />the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom<br />as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy<br />offence, Claudio?</p><p>CLAUDIO <br />What but to speak of would offend again.</p><p>LUCIO <br />What, is't murder?</p><p>CLAUDIO <br />No.</p><p>LUCIO <br />Lechery?</p><p>CLAUDIO <br />Call it so.</p><p>Provost <br />Away, sir! you must go.</p><p>CLAUDIO <br />One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.</p><p>LUCIO <br />A hundred, if they'll do you any good.<br />Is lechery so look'd after?</p><p>CLAUDIO <br />Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract<br />I got possession of Julietta's bed:<br />You know the lady; she is fast my wife,<br />Save that we do the denunciation lack<br />Of outward order: this we came not to,<br />Only for propagation of a dower<br />Remaining in the coffer of her friends,<br />From whom we thought it meet to hide our love<br />Till time had made them for us. But it chances<br />The stealth of our most mutual entertainment<br />With character too gross is writ on Juliet.</p><p>LUCIO <br />With child, perhaps?</p><p>CLAUDIO <br />Unhappily, even so.<br />And the new deputy now for the duke--<br />Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,<br />Or whether that the body public be<br />A horse whereon the governor doth ride,<br />Who, newly in the seat, that it may know<br />He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;<br />Whether the tyranny be in his place,<br />Or in his emmence that fills it up,<br />I stagger in:--but this new governor<br />Awakes me all the enrolled penalties<br />Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall<br />So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round<br />And none of them been worn; and, for a name,<br />Now puts the drowsy and neglected act<br />Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.</p><p>LUCIO <br />I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on<br />thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,<br />may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to<br />him.</p><p>CLAUDIO <br />I have done so, but he's not to be found.<br />I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:<br />This day my sister should the cloister enter<br />And there receive her approbation:<br />Acquaint her with the danger of my state:<br />Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends<br />To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:<br />I have great hope in that; for in her youth<br />There is a prone and speechless dialect,<br />Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art<br />When she will play with reason and discourse,<br />And well she can persuade.</p><p>LUCIO <br />I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the<br />like, which else would stand under grievous<br />imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I<br />would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a<br />game of tick-tack. I'll to her.</p><p>CLAUDIO <br />I thank you, good friend Lucio.</p><p>LUCIO <br />Within two hours.</p><p>CLAUDIO <br />Come, officer, away!</p><p>Exeunt</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span><span id = 2101 ><p>SCENE III. A monastery.</p><p>Enter DUKE VINCENTIO and FRIAR THOMAS <br />DUKE VINCENTIO <br />No, holy father; throw away that thought;<br />Believe not that the dribbling dart of love<br />Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee<br />To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose<br />More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends<br />Of burning youth.</p><p>FRIAR THOMAS <br />May your grace speak of it?</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />My holy sir, none better knows than you<br />How I have ever loved the life removed<br />And held in idle price to haunt assemblies<br />Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.<br />I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,<br />A man of stricture and firm abstinence,<br />My absolute power and place here in Vienna,<br />And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;<br />For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,<br />And so it is received. Now, pious sir,<br />You will demand of me why I do this?</p><p>FRIAR THOMAS <br />Gladly, my lord.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />We have strict statutes and most biting laws.<br />The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,<br />Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;<br />Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,<br />That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,<br />Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,<br />Only to stick it in their children's sight<br />For terror, not to use, in time the rod<br />Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,<br />Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;<br />And liberty plucks justice by the nose;<br />The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart<br />Goes all decorum.</p><p>FRIAR THOMAS <br />It rested in your grace<br />To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:<br />And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd<br />Than in Lord Angelo.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />I do fear, too dreadful:<br />Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,<br />'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them<br />For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,<br />When evil deeds have their permissive pass<br />And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,<br />I have on Angelo imposed the office;<br />Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,<br />And yet my nature never in the fight<br />To do in slander. And to behold his sway,<br />I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,<br />Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,<br />Supply me with the habit and instruct me<br />How I may formally in person bear me<br />Like a true friar. More reasons for this action<br />At our more leisure shall I render you;<br />Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;<br />Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses<br />That his blood flows, or that his appetite<br />Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,<br />If power change purpose, what our seemers be.</p><p>Exeunt<br /></p></span><span id = 2102 ><p>SCENE IV.

Upon his place,<br />And with full line of his authority,<br />Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood<br />Is very snow-broth; one who never feels<br />The wanton stings and motions of the sense,<br />But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge<br />With profits of the mind, study and fast.<br />He--to give fear to use and liberty,<br />Which have for long run by the hideous law,<br />As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,<br />Under whose heavy sense your brother's life<br />Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;<br />And follows close the rigour of the statute,<br />To make him an example. All hope is gone,<br />Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer<br />To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business<br />'Twixt you and your poor brother.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />Doth he so seek his life?</p><p>LUCIO <br />Has censured him<br />Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath<br />A warrant for his execution.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />Alas! what poor ability's in me<br />To do him good?</p><p>LUCIO <br />Assay the power you have.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />My power? Alas, I doubt--</p><p>LUCIO <br />Our doubts are traitors<br />And make us lose the good we oft might win<br />By fearing to attempt.

He, sir,<br />sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in<br />the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delight<br />to sit, have you not?</p><p>FROTH <br />I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.</p><p>POMPEY <br />Why, very well, then; I hope here be truths.</p><p>ANGELO <br />This will last out a night in Russia,<br />When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.<br />And leave you to the hearing of the cause;<br />Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />I think no less.

Doth your honour mark his face?</p><p>ESCALUS <br />Ay, sir, very well.</p><p>POMPEY <br />Nay; I beseech you, mark it well.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />Well, I do so.</p><p>POMPEY <br />Doth your honour see any harm in his face?</p><p>ESCALUS <br />Why, no.</p><p>POMPEY <br />I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst<br />thing about him. Good, then; if his face be the<br />worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the<br />constable's wife any harm? I would know that of<br />your honour.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?</p><p>ELBOW <br />First, an it like you, the house is a respected<br />house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his<br />mistress is a respected woman.</p><p>POMPEY <br />By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected<br />person than any of us all.</p><p>ELBOW <br />Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the<br />time has yet to come that she was ever respected<br />with man, woman, or child.</p><p>POMPEY <br />Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />Which is the wiser here?

If ever I was respected with her, or she<br />with me, let not your worship think me the poor<br />duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or<br />I'll have mine action of battery on thee.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your<br />action of slander too.</p><p>ELBOW <br />Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't<br />your worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?</p><p>ESCALUS <br />Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him<br />that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him<br />continue in his courses till thou knowest what they<br />are.</p><p>ELBOW <br />Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou<br />wicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art<br />to continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />Where were you born, friend?</p><p>FROTH <br />Here in Vienna, sir.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />Are you of fourscore pounds a year?</p><p>FROTH <br />Yes, an't please you, sir.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />So. What trade are you of, sir?</p><p>POMPHEY <br />Tapster; a poor widow's tapster.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />Your mistress' name?</p><p>POMPHEY <br />Mistress Overdone.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />Hath she had any more than one husband?</p><p>POMPEY <br />Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />Nine!

Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,<br />howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you<br />not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.</p><p>POMPEY <br />Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? What<br />do you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?</p><p>POMPEY <br />If the law would allow it, sir.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall<br />not be allowed in Vienna.</p><p>POMPEY <br />Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the<br />youth of the city?</p><p>ESCALUS <br />No, Pompey.</p><p>POMPEY <br />Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then.<br />If your worship will take order for the drabs and<br />the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:<br />it is but heading and hanging.</p><p>POMPEY <br />If you head and hang all that offend that way but<br />for ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a<br />commission for more heads: if this law hold in<br />Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in it<br />after three-pence a bay: if you live to see this<br />come to pass, say Pompey told you so.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your<br />prophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find<br />you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever;<br />no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,<br />I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd<br />Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall<br />have you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.</p><p>POMPEY <br />I thank your worship for your good counsel:</p><p>Aside</p><p>but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall<br />better determine.<br />Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:<br />The valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade.</p><p>Exit</p><p>ESCALUS <br />Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master<br />constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?</p><p>ELBOW <br />Seven year and a half, sir.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />I thought, by your readiness in the office, you had<br />continued in it some time. You say, seven years together?</p><p>ELBOW <br />And a half, sir.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you<br />wrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not men<br />in your ward sufficient to serve it?</p><p>ELBOW <br />Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they<br />are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I<br />do it for some piece of money, and go through with<br />all.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven,<br />the most sufficient of your parish.</p><p>ELBOW <br />To your worship's house, sir?</p><p>ESCALUS <br />To my house.

Is this her fault or mine?<br />The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?<br />Ha!<br />Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I<br />That, lying by the violet in the sun,<br />Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,<br />Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be<br />That modesty may more betray our sense<br />Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,<br />Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary<br />And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!<br />What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?<br />Dost thou desire her foully for those things<br />That make her good? O, let her brother live!<br />Thieves for their robbery have authority<br />When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,<br />That I desire to hear her speak again,<br />And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?<br />O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,<br />With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous<br />Is that temptation that doth goad us on<br />To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,<br />With all her double vigour, art and nature,<br />Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid<br />Subdues me quite.

Blood, thou art blood:<br />Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:<br />'Tis not the devil's crest.</p><p>Enter a Servant</p><p>How now! who's there?</p><p>Servant <br />One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.</p><p>ANGELO <br />Teach her the way.</p><p>Exit Servant</p><p>O heavens!<br />Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,<br />Making both it unable for itself,<br />And dispossessing all my other parts<br />Of necessary fitness?<br />So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;<br />Come all to help him, and so stop the air<br />By which he should revive: and even so<br />The general, subject to a well-wish'd king,<br />Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness<br />Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love<br />Must needs appear offence.</p><p>Enter ISABELLA</p><p>How now, fair maid?</p><p>ISABELLA <br />I am come to know your pleasure.</p><p>ANGELO <br />That you might know it, would much better please me<br />Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />Even so. Heaven keep your honour!</p><p>ANGELO <br />Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,</p><p>As long as you or I <br />yet he must die.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />Under your sentence?</p><p>ANGELO <br />Yea.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,<br />Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted<br />That his soul sicken not.</p><p>ANGELO <br />Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good<br />To pardon him that hath from nature stolen<br />A man already made, as to remit<br />Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image<br />In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy<br />Falsely to take away a life true made<br />As to put metal in restrained means<br />To make a false one.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.</p><p>ANGELO <br />Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.<br />Which had you rather, that the most just law<br />Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,<br />Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness<br />As she that he hath stain'd?</p><p>ISABELLA <br />Sir, believe this,<br />I had rather give my body than my soul.</p><p>ANGELO <br />I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins<br />Stand more for number than for accompt.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />How say you?</p><p>ANGELO <br />Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak<br />Against the thing I say. Answer to this:<br />I, now the voice of the recorded law,<br />Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:<br />Might there not be a charity in sin<br />To save this brother's life?</p><p>ISABELLA <br />Please you to do't,<br />I'll take it as a peril to my soul,<br />It is no sin at all, but charity.</p><p>ANGELO <br />Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,<br />Were equal poise of sin and charity.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />That I do beg his life, if it be sin,<br />Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,<br />If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer<br />To have it added to the faults of mine,<br />And nothing of your answer.</p><p>ANGELO <br />Nay, but hear me.<br />Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,<br />Or seem so craftily; and that's not good.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,<br />But graciously to know I am no better.</p><p>ANGELO <br />Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright<br />When it doth tax itself; as these black masks<br />Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder<br />Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me;<br />To be received plain, I'll speak more gross:<br />Your brother is to die.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />So.</p><p>ANGELO <br />And his offence is so, as it appears,<br />Accountant to the law upon that pain.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />True.</p><p>ANGELO <br />Admit no other way to save his life,--<br />As I subscribe not that, nor any other,<br />But in the loss of question,--that you, his sister,<br />Finding yourself desired of such a person,<br />Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,<br />Could fetch your brother from the manacles<br />Of the all-building law; and that there were<br />No earthly mean to save him, but that either<br />You must lay down the treasures of your body<br />To this supposed, or else to let him suffer;<br />What would you do?</p><p>ISABELLA <br />As much for my poor brother as myself:<br />That is, were I under the terms of death,<br />The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,<br />And strip myself to death, as to a bed<br />That longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield<br />My body up to shame.</p><p>ANGELO <br />Then must your brother die.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />And 'twere the cheaper way:<br />Better it were a brother died at once,<br />Than that a sister, by redeeming him,<br />Should die for ever.</p><p>ANGELO <br />Were not you then as cruel as the sentence<br />That you have slander'd so?</p><p>ISABELLA <br />Ignomy in ransom and free pardon<br />Are of two houses: lawful mercy<br />Is nothing kin to foul redemption.</p><p>ANGELO <br />You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;<br />And rather proved the sliding of your brother<br />A merriment than a vice.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,<br />To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:<br />I something do excuse the thing I hate,<br />For his advantage that I dearly love.</p><p>ANGELO <br />We are all frail.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />Else let my brother die,<br />If not a feodary, but only he<br />Owe and succeed thy weakness.</p><p>ANGELO <br />Nay, women are frail too.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;<br />Which are as easy broke as they make forms.<br />Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar<br />In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;<br />For we are soft as our complexions are,<br />And credulous to false prints.</p><p>ANGELO <br />I think it well:<br />And from this testimony of your own sex,--<br />Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger<br />Than faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold;<br />I do arrest your words. Be that you are,<br />That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;<br />If you be one, as you are well express'd<br />By all external warrants, show it now,<br />By putting on the destined livery.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,<br />Let me entreat you speak the former language.</p><p>ANGELO <br />Plainly conceive, I love you.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />My brother did love Juliet,<br />And you tell me that he shall die for it.</p><p>ANGELO <br />He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />I know your virtue hath a licence in't,<br />Which seems a little fouler than it is,<br />To pluck on others.</p><p>ANGELO <br />Believe me, on mine honour,<br />My words express my purpose.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />Ha! little honour to be much believed,<br />And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!<br />I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:<br />Sign me a present pardon for my brother,<br />Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud<br />What man thou art.</p><p>ANGELO <br />Who will believe thee, Isabel?<br />My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,<br />My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,<br />Will so your accusation overweigh,<br />That you shall stifle in your own report<br />And smell of calumny. I have begun,<br />And now I give my sensual race the rein:<br />Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;<br />Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,<br />That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother<br />By yielding up thy body to my will;<br />Or else he must not only die the death,<br />But thy unkindness shall his death draw out<br />To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,<br />Or, by the affection that now guides me most,<br />I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,<br />Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.</p><p>Exit</p><p>ISABELLA <br />To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,<br />Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,<br />That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,<br />Either of condemnation or approof;<br />Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:<br />Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,<br />To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:<br />Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,<br />Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.<br />That, had he twenty heads to tender down<br />On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,<br />Before his sister should her body stoop<br />To such abhorr'd pollution.<br />Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:<br />More than our brother is our chastity.<br />I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,<br />And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.</p><p>Exit</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span><span id = 2110 ></span><span id = 2111 ><p>SCENE I.

Reason thus with life:<br />If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing<br />That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,<br />Servile to all the skyey influences,<br />That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,<br />Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;<br />For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun<br />And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;<br />For all the accommodations that thou bear'st<br />Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;<br />For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork<br />Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,<br />And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st<br />Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;<br />For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains<br />That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;<br />For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,<br />And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;<br />For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,<br />After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;<br />For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,<br />Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,<br />And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;<br />For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,<br />The mere effusion of thy proper loins,<br />Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,<br />For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,<br />But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,<br />Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth<br />Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms<br />Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,<br />Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,<br />To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this<br />That bears the name of life? Yet in this life<br />Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,<br />That makes these odds all even.</p><p>CLAUDIO <br />I humbly thank you.<br />To sue to live, I find I seek to die;<br />And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />[Within] What, ho!

Darest thou die?<br />The sense of death is most in apprehension;<br />And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,<br />In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great<br />As when a giant dies.</p><p>CLAUDIO <br />Why give you me this shame?<br />Think you I can a resolution fetch<br />From flowery tenderness? If I must die,<br />I will encounter darkness as a bride,<br />And hug it in mine arms.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />There spake my brother; there my father's grave<br />Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:<br />Thou art too noble to conserve a life<br />In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,<br />Whose settled visage and deliberate word<br />Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew<br />As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil<br />His filth within being cast, he would appear<br />A pond as deep as hell.</p><p>CLAUDIO <br />The prenzie Angelo!</p><p>ISABELLA <br />O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,<br />The damned'st body to invest and cover<br />In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?<br />If I would yield him my virginity,<br />Thou mightst be freed.</p><p>CLAUDIO <br />O heavens! it cannot be.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,<br />So to offend him still. This night's the time<br />That I should do what I abhor to name,<br />Or else thou diest to-morrow.</p><p>CLAUDIO <br />Thou shalt not do't.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />O, were it but my life,<br />I'ld throw it down for your deliverance<br />As frankly as a pin.</p><p>CLAUDIO <br />Thanks, dear Isabel.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.</p><p>CLAUDIO <br />Yes. Has he affections in him,<br />That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,<br />When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,<br />Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />Which is the least?</p><p>CLAUDIO <br />If it were damnable, he being so wise,<br />Why would he for the momentary trick<br />Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!</p><p>ISABELLA <br />What says my brother?</p><p>CLAUDIO <br />Death is a fearful thing.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />And shamed life a hateful.</p><p>CLAUDIO <br />Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;<br />To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;<br />This sensible warm motion to become<br />A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit<br />To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside<br />In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;<br />To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,<br />And blown with restless violence round about<br />The pendent world; or to be worse than worst<br />Of those that lawless and incertain thought<br />Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!<br />The weariest and most loathed worldly life<br />That age, ache, penury and imprisonment<br />Can lay on nature is a paradise<br />To what we fear of death.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />Alas, alas!</p><p>CLAUDIO <br />Sweet sister, let me live:<br />What sin you do to save a brother's life,<br />Nature dispenses with the deed so far<br />That it becomes a virtue.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />O you beast!<br />O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!<br />Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?<br />Is't not a kind of incest, to take life<br />From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?<br />Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!<br />For such a warped slip of wilderness<br />Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!<br />Die, perish! Might but my bending down<br />Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:<br />I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,<br />No word to save thee.</p><p>CLAUDIO <br />Nay, hear me, Isabel.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />O, fie, fie, fie!<br />Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.<br />Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:<br />'Tis best thou diest quickly.</p><p>CLAUDIO <br />O hear me, Isabella!</p><p>Re-enter DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />What is your will?</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and<br />by have some speech with you: the satisfaction I<br />would require is likewise your own benefit.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be<br />stolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.</p><p>Walks apart</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you<br />and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to<br />corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her<br />virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition<br />of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,<br />hath made him that gracious denial which he is most<br />glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I<br />know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to<br />death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes<br />that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to<br />your knees and make ready.</p><p>CLAUDIO <br />Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love<br />with life that I will sue to be rid of it.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Hold you there: farewell.</p><p>Exit CLAUDIO</p><p>Provost, a word with you!</p><p>Re-enter Provost</p><p>Provost <br />What's your will, father</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me<br />awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my<br />habit no loss shall touch her by my company.</p><p>Provost <br />In good time.</p><p>Exit Provost. ISABELLA comes forward</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:<br />the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty<br />brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of<br />your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever<br />fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,<br />fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but<br />that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should<br />wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this<br />substitute, and to save your brother?</p><p>ISABELLA <br />I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my<br />brother die by the law than my son should be<br />unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke<br />deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can<br />speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or<br />discover his government.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter<br />now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made<br />trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my<br />advisings: to the love I have in doing good a<br />remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe<br />that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged<br />lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from<br />the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious<br />person; and much please the absent duke, if<br />peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of<br />this business.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do<br />anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have<br />you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of<br />Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?</p><p>ISABELLA <br />I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />She should this Angelo have married; was affianced<br />to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between<br />which time of the contract and limit of the<br />solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,<br />having in that perished vessel the dowry of his<br />sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the<br />poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and<br />renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most<br />kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of<br />her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her<br />combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them<br />with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,<br />pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,<br />bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet<br />wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,<br />is washed with them, but relents not.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid<br />from the world! What corruption in this life, that<br />it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the<br />cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps<br />you from dishonour in doing it.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />Show me how, good father.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance<br />of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that<br />in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,<br />like an impediment in the current, made it more<br />violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his<br />requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with<br />his demands to the point; only refer yourself to<br />this advantage, first, that your stay with him may<br />not be long; that the time may have all shadow and<br />silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.<br />This being granted in course,--and now follows<br />all,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up<br />your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter<br />acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to<br />her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother<br />saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana<br />advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid<br />will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you<br />think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness<br />of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.<br />What think you of it?</p><p>ISABELLA <br />The image of it gives me content already; and I<br />trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily<br />to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his<br />bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will<br />presently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated<br />grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that<br />place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that<br />it may be quickly.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.</p><p>Exeunt severally</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span><span id = 2112 ><p>SCENE II.

Commend me to the prison,<br />Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; you<br />will keep the house.</p><p>POMPEY <br />I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.</p><p>LUCIO <br />No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.<br />I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If<br />you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the<br />more. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />And you.</p><p>LUCIO <br />Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?</p><p>ELBOW <br />Come your ways, sir; come.</p><p>POMPEY <br />You will not bail me, then, sir?</p><p>LUCIO <br />Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?<br />what news?</p><p>ELBOW <br />Come your ways, sir; come.</p><p>LUCIO <br />Go to kennel, Pompey; go.</p><p>Exeunt ELBOW, POMPEY and Officers</p><p>What news, friar, of the duke?</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />I know none. Can you tell me of any?</p><p>LUCIO <br />Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other<br />some, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.</p><p>LUCIO <br />It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from<br />the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born<br />to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he<br />puts transgression to 't.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />He does well in 't.</p><p>LUCIO <br />A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in<br />him: something too crabbed that way, friar.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.</p><p>LUCIO <br />Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;<br />it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp<br />it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put<br />down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and<br />woman after this downright way of creation: is it<br />true, think you?</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />How should he be made, then?</p><p>LUCIO <br />Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he<br />was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is<br />certain that when he makes water his urine is<br />congealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a<br />motion generative; that's infallible.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.</p><p>LUCIO <br />Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the<br />rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a<br />man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?<br />Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a<br />hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing<br />a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he<br />knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />I never heard the absent duke much detected for<br />women; he was not inclined that way.</p><p>LUCIO <br />O, sir, you are deceived.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />'Tis not possible.</p><p>LUCIO <br />Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and<br />his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the<br />duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;<br />that let me inform you.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />You do him wrong, surely.</p><p>LUCIO <br />Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the<br />duke: and I believe I know the cause of his<br />withdrawing.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />What, I prithee, might be the cause?</p><p>LUCIO <br />No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the<br />teeth and the lips: but this I can let you<br />understand, the greater file of the subject held the<br />duke to be wise.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Wise! why, no question but he was.</p><p>LUCIO <br />A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:<br />the very stream of his life and the business he hath<br />helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better<br />proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own<br />bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the<br />envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.<br />Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your<br />knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.</p><p>LUCIO <br />Sir, I know him, and I love him.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with<br />dearer love.</p><p>LUCIO <br />Come, sir, I know what I know.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />I can hardly believe that, since you know not what<br />you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our<br />prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your<br />answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,<br />you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call<br />upon you; and, I pray you, your name?</p><p>LUCIO <br />Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to<br />report you.</p><p>LUCIO <br />I fear you not.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you<br />imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I<br />can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.</p><p>LUCIO <br />I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,<br />friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if<br />Claudio die to-morrow or no?</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Why should he die, sir?</p><p>LUCIO <br />Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would<br />the duke we talk of were returned again: the<br />ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with<br />continency; sparrows must not build in his<br />house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke<br />yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would<br />never bring them to light: would he were returned!<br />Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.<br />Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The<br />duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on<br />Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,<br />he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown<br />bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.</p><p>Exit</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />No might nor greatness in mortality<br />Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny<br />The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong<br />Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?<br />But who comes here?</p><p>Enter ESCALUS, Provost, and Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE</p><p>ESCALUS <br />Go; away with her to prison!</p><p>MISTRESS OVERDONE <br />Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounted<br />a merciful man; good my lord.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in<br />the same kind!

Away with her to prison! Go to;<br />no more words.</p><p>Exeunt Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE</p><p>Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered;<br />Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished<br />with divines, and have all charitable preparation.<br />if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be<br />so with him.</p><p>Provost <br />So please you, this friar hath been with him, and<br />advised him for the entertainment of death.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />Good even, good father.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Bliss and goodness on you!</p><p>ESCALUS <br />Of whence are you?</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Not of this country, though my chance is now<br />To use it for my time: I am a brother<br />Of gracious order, late come from the See<br />In special business from his holiness.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />What news abroad i' the world?</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />None, but that there is so great a fever on<br />goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:<br />novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous<br />to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous<br />to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce<br />truth enough alive to make societies secure; but<br />security enough to make fellowships accurst: much<br />upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This<br />news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I<br />pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?</p><p>ESCALUS <br />One that, above all other strifes, contended<br />especially to know himself.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />What pleasure was he given to?</p><p>ESCALUS <br />Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at<br />any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a<br />gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to<br />his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;<br />and let me desire to know how you find Claudio<br />prepared. I am made to understand that you have<br />lent him visitation.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />He professes to have received no sinister measure<br />from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself<br />to the determination of justice: yet had he framed<br />to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many<br />deceiving promises of life; which I by my good<br />leisure have discredited to him, and now is he<br />resolved to die.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />You have paid the heavens your function, and the<br />prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have<br />laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest<br />shore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I<br />found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him<br />he is indeed Justice.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />If his own life answer the straitness of his<br />proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he<br />chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />I am going to visit the prisoner.

I<br />have heard it was ever his manner to do so.</p><p>Provost <br />His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,<br />indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord<br />Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />It is now apparent?</p><p>Provost <br />Most manifest, and not denied by himself.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how<br />seems he to be touched?</p><p>Provost <br />A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but<br />as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless<br />of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of<br />mortality, and desperately mortal.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />He wants advice.</p><p>Provost <br />He will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty<br />of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he<br />would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days<br />entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if<br />to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming<br />warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />More of him anon. There is written in your brow,<br />provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not<br />truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the<br />boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.<br />Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is<br />no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath<br />sentenced him.

I may make my case<br />as Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my<br />instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine<br />be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.</p><p>Provost <br />Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.<br />Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was<br />the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his<br />death: you know the course is common. If any thing<br />fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good<br />fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead<br />against it with my life.</p><p>Provost <br />Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?</p><p>Provost <br />To him, and to his substitutes.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />You will think you have made no offence, if the duke<br />avouch the justice of your dealing?</p><p>Provost <br />But what likelihood is in that?</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see<br />you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor<br />persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go<br />further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.<br />Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the<br />duke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the<br />signet is not strange to you.</p><p>Provost <br />I know them both.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />The contents of this is the return of the duke: you<br />shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you<br />shall find, within these two days he will be here.<br />This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this<br />very day receives letters of strange tenor;<br />perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering<br />into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what<br />is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the<br />shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these<br />things should be: all difficulties are but easy<br />when they are known.

I do perceive<br />These poor informal women are no more<br />But instruments of some more mightier member<br />That sets them on: let me have way, my lord,<br />To find this practise out.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Ay, with my heart<br />And punish them to your height of pleasure.<br />Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,<br />Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,<br />Though they would swear down each particular saint,<br />Were testimonies against his worth and credit<br />That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,<br />Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains<br />To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.<br />There is another friar that set them on;<br />Let him be sent for.</p><p>FRIAR PETER <br />Would he were here, my lord! for he indeed<br />Hath set the women on to this complaint:<br />Your provost knows the place where he abides<br />And he may fetch him.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Go do it instantly.</p><p>Exit Provost</p><p>And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,<br />Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,<br />Do with your injuries as seems you best,<br />In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;<br />But stir not you till you have well determined<br />Upon these slanderers.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />My lord, we'll do it throughly.</p><p>Exit DUKE</p><p>Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that<br />Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?</p><p>LUCIO <br />'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing<br />but in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most<br />villanous speeches of the duke.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and<br />enforce them against him: we shall find this friar a<br />notable fellow.</p><p>LUCIO <br />As any in Vienna, on my word.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her.</p><p>Exit an Attendant</p><p>Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you<br />shall see how I'll handle her.</p><p>LUCIO <br />Not better than he, by her own report.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />Say you?</p><p>LUCIO <br />Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately,<br />she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly,<br />she'll be ashamed.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />I will go darkly to work with her.</p><p>LUCIO <br />That's the way; for women are light at midnight.</p><p>Re-enter Officers with ISABELLA; and Provost with the DUKE VINCENTIO in his friar's habit</p><p>ESCALUS <br />Come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies all<br />that you have said.</p><p>LUCIO <br />My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here with<br />the provost.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />In very good time: speak not you to him till we<br />call upon you.</p><p>LUCIO <br />Mum.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />Come, sir: did you set these women on to slander<br />Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />'Tis false.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />How! know you where you are?</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Respect to your great place! and let the devil<br />Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!<br />Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:<br />Look you speak justly.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,<br />Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?<br />Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?<br />Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,<br />Thus to retort your manifest appeal,<br />And put your trial in the villain's mouth<br />Which here you come to accuse.</p><p>LUCIO <br />This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,<br />Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women<br />To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth<br />And in the witness of his proper ear,<br />To call him villain? and then to glance from him<br />To the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?<br />Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you<br />Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.<br />What 'unjust'!</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Be not so hot; the duke<br />Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he<br />Dare rack his own: his subject am I not,<br />Nor here provincial. My business in this state<br />Made me a looker on here in Vienna,<br />Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble<br />Till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,<br />But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes<br />Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,<br />As much in mock as mark.</p><p>ESCALUS <br />Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!</p><p>ANGELO <br />What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?<br />Is this the man that you did tell us of?</p><p>LUCIO <br />'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate:<br />do you know me?</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: I<br />met you at the prison, in the absence of the duke.</p><p>LUCIO <br />O, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke?</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Most notedly, sir.</p><p>LUCIO <br />Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, a<br />fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />You must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make<br />that my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; and<br />much more, much worse.</p><p>LUCIO <br />O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the<br />nose for thy speeches?</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />I protest I love the duke as I love myself.</p><p>ANGELO <br />Hark, how the villain would close now, after his<br />treasonable abuses!</p><p>ESCALUS <br />Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with<br />him to prison! Where is the provost? Away with him<br />to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him<br />speak no more. Away with those giglots too, and<br />with the other confederate companion!</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />[To Provost] Stay, sir; stay awhile.</p><p>ANGELO <br />What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.</p><p>LUCIO <br />Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you<br />bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, must<br />you? Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you!<br />show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!<br />Will't not off?</p><p>Pulls off the friar's hood, and discovers DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.<br />First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.</p><p>To LUCIO</p><p>Sneak not away, sir; for the friar and you<br />Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.</p><p>LUCIO <br />This may prove worse than hanging.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />[To ESCALUS] What you have spoke I pardon: sit you down:<br />We'll borrow place of him.</p><p>To ANGELO</p><p>Sir, by your leave.<br />Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,<br />That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,<br />Rely upon it till my tale be heard,<br />And hold no longer out.</p><p>ANGELO <br />O my dread lord,<br />I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,<br />To think I can be undiscernible,<br />When I perceive your grace, like power divine,<br />Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,<br />No longer session hold upon my shame,<br />But let my trial be mine own confession:<br />Immediate sentence then and sequent death<br />Is all the grace I beg.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Come hither, Mariana.<br />Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?</p><p>ANGELO <br />I was, my lord.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Go take her hence, and marry her instantly.<br />Do you the office, friar; which consummate,<br />Return him here again. Go with him, provost.</p><p>Exeunt ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER and Provost</p><p>ESCALUS <br />My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour<br />Than at the strangeness of it.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Come hither, Isabel.<br />Your friar is now your prince: as I was then<br />Advertising and holy to your business,<br />Not changing heart with habit, I am still<br />Attorney'd at your service.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />O, give me pardon,<br />That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd<br />Your unknown sovereignty!</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />You are pardon'd, Isabel:<br />And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.<br />Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;<br />And you may marvel why I obscured myself,<br />Labouring to save his life, and would not rather<br />Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power<br />Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,<br />It was the swift celerity of his death,<br />Which I did think with slower foot came on,<br />That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!<br />That life is better life, past fearing death,<br />Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,<br />So happy is your brother.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />I do, my lord.</p><p>Re-enter ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER, and Provost</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />For this new-married man approaching here,<br />Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd<br />Your well defended honour, you must pardon<br />For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--<br />Being criminal, in double violation<br />Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach<br />Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,--<br />The very mercy of the law cries out<br />Most audible, even from his proper tongue,<br />'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'<br />Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;<br />Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.<br />Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;<br />Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.<br />We do condemn thee to the very block<br />Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.<br />Away with him!</p><p>MARIANA <br />O my most gracious lord,<br />I hope you will not mock me with a husband.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.<br />Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,<br />I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,<br />For that he knew you, might reproach your life<br />And choke your good to come; for his possessions,<br />Although by confiscation they are ours,<br />We do instate and widow you withal,<br />To buy you a better husband.</p><p>MARIANA <br />O my dear lord,<br />I crave no other, nor no better man.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Never crave him; we are definitive.</p><p>MARIANA <br />Gentle my liege,--</p><p>Kneeling</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />You do but lose your labour.<br />Away with him to death!</p><p>To LUCIO</p><p>Now, sir, to you.</p><p>MARIANA <br />O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;<br />Lend me your knees, and all my life to come<br />I'll lend you all my life to do you service.</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />Against all sense you do importune her:<br />Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,<br />Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,<br />And take her hence in horror.</p><p>MARIANA <br />Isabel,<br />Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;<br />Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.<br />They say, best men are moulded out of faults;<br />And, for the most, become much more the better<br />For being a little bad: so may my husband.<br />O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?</p><p>DUKE VINCENTIO <br />He dies for Claudio's death.</p><p>ISABELLA <br />Most bounteous sir,</p><p>Kneeling</p><p>Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,<br />As if my brother lived: I partly think<br />A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,<br />Till he did look on me: since it is so,<br />Let him not die.
