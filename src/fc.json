-- you know that word!&nbsp; It refers to the genital region, and whenever it''s used, it conjures up the idea of sex.&nbsp; Shakespeare chooses to say \"the families had children\" in a way that draws our attention to sex.&nbsp; The adjective \"fatal,\" which modifies \"loins,\" has two meanings, which together introduce two important, conflicting, themes in the play.&nbsp; The first meaning is \"relating to fate,\" while the second is \"deadly.\"&nbsp; If we consider the first meaning, \"fatal loins\" introduces the idea that the lovers are controlled, from their very birth, by an impersonal higher power&mdash;i.e., Fate; but if we take \"fatal\" to mean \"deadly,\" then \"fatal loins\" gives us an&nbsp; oxymoron (a combination of two contradictory ideas), since it suggests that the sexual organs of Romeo''s and Juliet''s parents, which should create life by producing a baby, are deadly, that is, capable of killing.&nbsp; How can this oxymoron make sense?&nbsp; Shakespeare implies that since the two families are so concerned with killing and violence, even their act of reproduction&mdash;which should renew life&mdash;is infected by their viciousness, and instead leads to death.&nbsp; In other words, Romeo and Juliet are born to and brought up by families poisoned by the hatred of the feud they maintain, a hatred that will make it impossible for their love to exist and leads to their deaths.&nbsp; \"Fatal loins\" can thus indicate either that the children (Romeo and Juliet) have no control over their lives but are instead ruled by an impersonal fate; or, instead, that it is the fault of their families, and not of Fate, that their love is doomed, and that they die.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one expects you to spend this much time thinking about every passage in the play; but as you read, you''ll want to choose certain passages that stand out to you and attempt the same kind of analysis I''ve just performed for the sonnet.&nbsp; First, determine exactly what''s happening; and next, choose words and thoughts that strike you as intriguing, or that remind you of other parts of the play.&nbsp; As your guide, I''ll be pointing out crucial themes and images and ideas in the play.&nbsp; I''ll occasionally also direct your attention to particularly enjoyable (or raunchy, or violent, or funny) images.&nbsp; After all, this is a play about growing up during a violent feud; in other words, its main subjects are sex and violence.&nbsp; Especially in terms of sex, it can be as explicit as Hollywood has ever been.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So let''s read!<br /><br />'", "tags": null, "uri": "The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet 4.html", "ranges": {"start": "/span[2]", "end": "/span[3]", "startOffset": 8, "endOffset": 624}, "annotator_schema_version": "v1.0", "user": 8, "quote": " 'Two households, both alike in dignity,   /  In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,   /  From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,   /  Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.   /  From forth the fatal loins of these two foes   /  A pair of star-cross''d lovers take their life;   /  Whole misadventured piteous overthrows   /  Do with their death bury their parents'' strife.   /  The fearful passage of their death-mark''d love,   /  And the continuance of their parents'' rage,   /  Which, but their children''s end, nought could remove,   /  Is now the two hours'' traffic of our stage;   /  The which if you with patient ears attend,   /  What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

In his innocence, Duncan resembles the character of the saintly but ineffectual Henry VI in the three plays about his chaotic reign that Shakespeare had worked on at the beginning of his career.

If Benvolio is simply saying to Romeo, &ldquo;there&rsquo;ll be a bunch of gorgeous girls at the feast,&rdquo; then Lady Capulet is telling Juliet something altogether more complex&mdash;but ultimately, her meaning, despite the intricacy of her speech, doesn&rsquo;t amount to much more than &ldquo;look at him, and then decide to marry him.&rdquo;<br /><br />'", "tags": null, "uri": "The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet 4.html", "ranges": {"start": "/span[5]", "end": "/span[6]", "startOffset": 3624, "endOffset": 3712}, "annotator_schema_version": "v1.0", "user": 8, "quote": " 'Read o''er the volume of young Paris'' face,   /  And find delight writ there with beauty''s pen;

Juliet&rsquo;s reply to her mother is one of the most delicious moments of the play.&nbsp; Read her first line out loud (indeed, you should be reading many of these lines aloud &mdash; Shakespeare meant them to be spoken!), and marvel at the pert alliteration and crisp consonance and charming assonance.&nbsp; The sound of the language complements its sense: Juliet seems to be obeying her mother to the letter, saying she&rsquo;ll consider Paris without being improperly affectionate, only going so far as to follow her mother&rsquo;s advice in considering his offer of marriage.&nbsp; But Juliet is actually hedging&mdash;she doesn&rsquo;t in fact consent to marry Paris, but instead, by adopting the guise of an extraordinarily submissive daughter, manages to avoid committing to the marriage.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look to like, if looking liking move,&rdquo; which expresses a tripping delicacy in its sound, demonstrates the agility of Juliet''s mind in cleverly disobeying her mother by seeming to obey her.&nbsp; How does she disobey?&nbsp; In reponse to her mother''s question, \"can you like of Paris'' love?\", i.e., \"can you accept his love?\", she replies \"I''ll look to like\" (i.e. \"I''ll attempt to like him\") \"if looking liking move,\" i.e., \"if looking at him can make me like him.\"&nbsp; Or that''s the meaning her mother probably accepts; but Juliet uses the word \"look\" (look/looking) twice in a single line&mdash;and \"look\" has two meanings.&nbsp; The second part of her line can be read with either the literal meaning, \"to gaze at\"&mdash;or with the figurative meaning that it takes in the first part of her line, in which case Juliet''s meaning is \"I''ll try to like him, if trying to like him will make me like him.\"&nbsp; Equivocation, pure and simple, that she means her mother to misunderstand as obedience.&nbsp; Later in the play, too, when the situation is more desperate, Juliet will speak in double-meanings to her mother so that Lady Capulet thinks her daughter obeys when in fact Juliet is rejecting her mother''s authority. &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike Romeo, who enters the play using the borrowed language of the oxymoron, which expresses the sentiments of a love (for Rosaline) that he probably doesn''t really feel, Juliet comes onstage in full command of a subtle language all her own that allows her, at thirteen years old, to function as a private and independent young woman.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The contrasting portrayal of Romeo and Juliet, accomplished through the language they speak, reminds us of Shakespeare''s astonishing virtuosity as a writer&mdash;of why he''s considered the greatest poet in the English language.&nbsp; If we read his lines too quickly, Shakespeare''s characterization will escape us: all of his language seems so beautiful, so impossibly eloquent.&nbsp; But if you pay attention to the subtleties of his language&mdash;how and why each character speaks the way he or she does&mdash;you''ll realize that the beauty of Shakespeare''s words is never \"beauty for beauty''s sake\"; rather, the sheer splendor of his language is always enlisted in a carefully, rigorously organized dramatic plan&mdash;here, the contrasting characterization of the title-characters.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feel free to get caught up in the sheer beauty of the language&mdash;in fact, you''re missing a lot if you don''t.&nbsp; Most of the time, when I read Shakespeare, I''m so overwhelmed by the poetry itself that I can''t concentrate on the subtleties of meaning; only on a second reading, or even a third, can I begin to escape the magnetic allure of the beautiful language.&nbsp; So to reiterate: be seduced by Shakespeare''s words; but after you''ve wallowed in their beauty, think long and hard about them.&nbsp; Once you''ve gained access to some of the deeper meanings governing the play, your admiration for Shakespeare''s language will only increase.<br /><br />'", "tags": null, "uri": "The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet 4.html", "ranges": {"start": "/span[5]", "end": "/span[6]", "startOffset": 4314, "endOffset": 4443}, "annotator_schema_version": "v1.0", "user": 8, "quote": " 'I''ll look to like, if looking liking move:   /  But no more deep will I endart mine eye   /  Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.

Act 2 begins with another sonnet pronounced by the Chorus.&nbsp; Act 1 has given us some of Shakespeare&rsquo;s great lines, from Juliet&rsquo;s pert and agile first words to Mercutio&rsquo;s fantastic imaginings.&nbsp; With the duo love-sonnet that constitutes Romeo and Juliet&rsquo;s first interaction, Shakespeare ratchets up the intensity of the play&rsquo;s lyricism, enlisting a formal lyric device&mdash;that is, the sonnet&mdash;to generate the erotic charge between the lovers.&nbsp; And with the enforced parting that separates Romeo and Juliet as soon as they&rsquo;ve begun passionately to kiss, Shakespeare manipulates the audience through frustration&mdash;just as the play rises to a new level in beauty of language, in emotional temperature, in excitement, the lovers are separated.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing like frustrated desire to increase that desire.&nbsp; Note Shakespeare&rsquo;s genius as a dramatic playwright: this separation not only serves the play&rsquo;s plot by increasing Romeo and Juliet&rsquo;s mutual desire; it also increases our desire, as the audience, to see the lovers reunited.&nbsp; Shakespeare is very much aware that he&rsquo;s writing for an audience, and he takes great pains to make the experience of the audience as exciting as the experience of the characters within his play.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All that said&mdash;with the temperature of the play rising, the lovers parted even as they kiss, the action pressing forward towards the famous balcony scene&mdash;Shakespeare then includes another expository sonnet that, quite frankly, is rather dull.&nbsp; One early edition (Q1) of the play doesn&rsquo;t include this sonnet; I wish it had never been included in any edition of the play, for it retards the play&rsquo;s forward surge with tedious and, worse, superfluous exposition.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does it say?&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a quick prose paraphrase:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Romeo&rsquo;s forgotten his old crush; when he saw Juliet, Rosaline no longer seemed beautiful.&nbsp; In fact, Juliet loves Romeo, too [remember how Rosaline didn&rsquo;t return Romeo&rsquo;s affection?].&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s a problem: their families are enemies, so it&rsquo;ll be difficult for them to meet the way most lovers can.&nbsp; With the strength of their passion, however, they&rsquo;ll find a way to see each other.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All this information is quite obvious to the audience or the reader.&nbsp; Beyond the literal meaning of the poetry, does the language of the sonnet encode some more profound meaning or thematic content?&nbsp; In its imagery, the sonnet simply recycles what we&rsquo;ve already seen and heard: &ldquo;Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie, / And young affection gapes to be his heir&rdquo; &mdash; Juliet has just cried, &ldquo;If he [Romeo] is marri&egrave;d, / My grave is like to be my wedding bed.&rdquo;&nbsp; As for organization, the sonnet is constructed as a plot-summary&mdash;and, unlike most well-written sonnets, then, it isn&rsquo;t united by an underlying theme.&nbsp; It does, however, end with a strong sentiment, couched in language somewhat more powerful than the rather pedestrian writing of lines 1-12: \"But passion lends them power, time means, to meet, / Temp''ring extremities with extreme sweet.\"&nbsp; The immense dangers to which the lovers expose themselves will be tempered&mdash;that is, qualified, or made less&mdash;by immense pleasures (let your imagination conjure up what those pleasures might be).&nbsp; The phrase \"temp''ring extremities with extreme sweet\" should catch your attention: first, it has a genuinely Shakespearean ring; second, it''s a somewhat clumsy oxymoron.&nbsp; \"Extremities\" is not the precise opposite of \"extreme sweet,\" but Shakespeare means the two to oppose one another.&nbsp; The oxymoron has infected the language of the play since its opening; beyond its use in conveying Romeo''s aping of adult mannerisms and, later, Juliet''s extreme emotion, perhaps&mdash;we should begin to think&mdash;the oxymoron has some more profound significance in the play.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let''s reconsider the definition of the oxymoron.&nbsp; The union of two opposites.&nbsp; But what, ultimately, is a heterosexual relationship?&nbsp; Just that: the union of opposites.&nbsp; In many ways, Romeo and Juliet is a play about discovering sexuality&mdash;Juliet is thirteen and arriving at full sexual development; Romeo is in his mid-to-late teens, arriving (since men mature later than women) at the same relative stage.&nbsp; Their falling in love is not merely an emotional, but also very much a sexual, awakening (we''ll be looking at this further in a few scenes); and their mutual sexual awakening also catalyzes and drives a rapid process of maturation.&nbsp; But the bottom line, for now: their relationship&mdash;the mystery of attraction between heterosexual men and women, a mystery these lovers have just discovered and begun to marvel at&mdash;is a physical oxymoron, the male and female united.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even further: Romeo and Juliet stand as more than just a pair of opposites in their sex&mdash;they come from families at war.&nbsp; Their relationship is thus also a social oxymoron&mdash;a union of two fatally opposed families.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what, you''re saying, does all this have to do with the sonnet at the beginning of act 2?&nbsp; And why am I not, you ask, letting you continue reading?&nbsp; Here''s the reason: I wanted to point out that this sonnet does, despite its seeming superfluousness (it tells us what we already know and what we''re about to see in the balcony scene) have a relation to the overarching thematic concerns of the play&mdash;its final lines provide a mixed oxymoron: the social (and physical) danger of their meeting combined with the extreme delights of that meeting.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I want to say that, despite that thematic connection, the sonnet still irks me.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; In addition to its superfluousness in imparting to us the plot, the sonnet also makes itself far too obvious in spelling out the theme of oxymoron.&nbsp; Here''s an old truism: show, don''t tell.&nbsp; By telling us that the lovers'' passion will make up for the dangers they risk, Shakespeare condescends to us, babies and cossets us.&nbsp; The following scene will show us more than this sonnet can possibly tell.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So remember: Shakespeare may be a writer of genius, but even a genius can make a mistake.&nbsp; This sonnet is an example.&nbsp; What follows the sonnet will redeem Shakespeare, for it constitutes one of the great scenes in Western drama&mdash;and one of the greatest passages in Western literature.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Eliot''s theory, that Shakespeare himself has lost track of the \"matter\" in the play at large (a theory that, as I will suggest, fails to explain the entrance of the ghost into this scene), then we have our work cut out for us.<br /><br />Let''s begin with a note on staging.&nbsp; Although setting the scene with a bed is now typical, Oxford''s editors take pains to point out that \"a closet is not a bedroom,\" and that the bed made its debut in the 1930s in a famous New York production.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the bed is as much a spectre as a physical presence, and as <i>readers </i>of Hamlet we may imagine what we will (within reason, of course).&nbsp; Now, on to the text.<br /><br />In 3.4 Hamlet is obsessed by his newly sexualized mother.&nbsp; This woman who was once mother and, to a lesser degree, wife, is now irrefutably a <i>lover</i>, and the bed at the center of her chamber has been the site of (gasp!) love-making with Claudius.&nbsp; That is the simplest theory, anyway.<br /><br />Another reading might suggest that Hamlet has finally found power over his mother, and that there is a thrill in its exercise.&nbsp; Recall that Gertrude has thus far deferred to Claudius in making decisions about Hamlet.&nbsp; Now, the two are alone, and she must confront him one on one.&nbsp; <br /><br />Greenblatt and others suggest that Hamlet''s obsession with Claudius and Gertrude as a couple exists alongside an obsession with Gertrude''s sexuality as such.&nbsp; In this reading, Hamlet''s deeply imagined fantasy of Gertrude''s sexuality (\"enseamed bed,\" e.g.) begin to make us uneasy.&nbsp; Just what does Hamlet <i>want</i> from his mother?<br /><br />Finally, click the link to read Eliot''s essay on Hamlet, which includes a brief treatment of Gertrude as an objective correlative.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"background: rgb(255, 255, 255) none repeat scroll 0% 50%;

Essentially, the ghost tells Hamlet \"you''re getting distracted!&nbsp; Your mother''s not the problem here, it''s your uncle you should be worried about.\"&nbsp; In Eliot''s language, the ghost would say, \"Can''t you see that your mother is an inadequate objective correlative for your emotions!?\"<br /><br />The ghost instead urges Hamlet to \"step between her and her fighting soul.\"&nbsp; The question raised by the line is what the meaning of \"her\" is, if \"her fighting soul\" is somehow divorced from it.&nbsp; We may read this as \"step between her reason and her soul,\" or \"between her conscience and her sou,\" but no matter what reading we give it we get the general thrust of the line.&nbsp; The ghost is worried that Hamlet is losing the plot of the play (that is, the plot of the revenge tragedy), and he emerges at this point to refocus the energies of his fraying son.<br /></span>'", "tags": null, "uri": "Hamlet 5.html", "ranges": {"start": "/span[14]", "end": "/span[15]", "startOffset": 5126, "endOffset": 5343}, "annotator_schema_version": "v1.0", "user": 23, "quote": " 'Do not forget: this visitation   /  Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.   /  But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:   /  O, step between her and her fighting soul:   /  Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:   /  Speak to her, Hamlet.

First, such immoderate lust and voluptuous sensuality (the abominable fountain of all vices) followeth me, that if I were made king of Scots, I should seek to deflower maids and matrons, in such wise that mine intemperance should be more importable unto you, than the bloodie tyranny of Makbeth now is.\" Hereunto Makduffe answered: \"This surely is a very evil fault, for many noble princes and kings have lost both lives and kingdoms for the same; nevertheless there are women enough in Scotland, and therefore follow my counsel. Make thy self king, and I shall convey the matter so wisely that thou shalt be so satisfied at thy pleasure in such secret wise, that no man shall be aware thereof.&rsquo;  /    /  &ldquo;Then said Malcolme, &lsquo;I am also the most avaricious creature on the earth, so that if I were king, I should seek so many ways to get lands and goods, that I would slay the most part of all the nobles of Scotland by surmised accusations, to the end I might enioy their lands, goods, and possessions; and therefore to show you what mischief may ensue on you through mine unsatiable covetousness, I will rehearse unto you a fable. There was a fox having a sore place on him overset with a swarm of flies, that continually sucked out her blood: and when one that came by and saw this manner, demanded whether she would have the flies driven beside her, she answered no: for if these flies that are already full, and by reason thereof suck not very eagerly, should be chased away, other that are empty and &lsquo;fellie an hungred&rsquo; [fierce by hunger] should light in their places, and suck out the residue of my blood far more to my grievance than these, which now being satisfied do not much annoy me. Therefore saith Malcolme, suffer me to remain where I am, least if I attain to the regiment of your realm, mine unquenchable avarice may prove such; that ye would think the displeasures which now grieve you, should seem easy in respect of the unmeasurable outrage, which might ensue through my coming amongst you.\"  /    /  &ldquo;Makduffe to this made answer, &lsquo;how it was a far worse fault than the other: for avarice is the root of all mischief, and for that crime the most part of our kings have been slaine and brought to their final end. Yet notwithstanding follow my counsel, and take upon thee the crown. There is gold and riches enough in Scotland to satisfy thy greedy desire.&rsquo; Then Malcolme again, &lsquo;I am furthermore inclined to dissimulation, telling of &lsquo;leasings&rsquo; [lies], and all other kinds of deceit, so that I naturally rejoyce in nothing so much, as to betray &amp; deceive such as put any trust or confidence in my words.

In his essay \"Shakespeare and the Exorcists,\" Greenblatt describes Lear as a play that has been \"emptied out\" - a play in which the meaning has been evacuated from ancient ritual, in which filial bonds become meaningless, and so on.&nbsp; <br /><br />Nothingness, therefore, is a fear that is central to Lear''s psychology.&nbsp; What infuriates Lear about Cordelia''s response - which is, admittedly, somewhat infuriating in its own right - is that it reveals what is underneath the concealing arts of her sisters: nothing.&nbsp; By refusing to dress up her love of her father in fancy language, Cordelia is, perhaps, offering a vision of love that is too powerful for Lear to accept.&nbsp; Or is he?<br /><br />One of the great questions of this play is: Why does this first scene have to turn out like this?&nbsp; Why does Lear think this division of his kingdom by \"love\" will be such a good idea?&nbsp; Why can''t he see through Regan and Goneril?&nbsp; Why can''t he see Cordelia''s love for what it is?&nbsp; <br /><br />I would like to introduce an interpretation of this scene that is in some ways at odds with the critical tradition, but which I think is illuminating for that very reason.&nbsp; This is Stanley Cavell''s interpretation from his excellent 1976 essay \"The Avoidance of&nbsp; Love.\"&nbsp; Cavell reads this scene as an effort by Lear to experience the kind of love that doesn''t require \"recognition.\"&nbsp; Whereas real love asks something in return (love, recognition, and so on), the artifice of love is much safer in that it demands nothing of its object.&nbsp; Cavell sees Lear as precisely the kind of man who fears recognition, and by extension fears all feminine love.&nbsp; He writes: \"He wards it off for the reason for which people do ward off being loved, because it presents itself to them as a demand.\"<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with Cavell, his is a good reading to keep in mind as this terrible scene sets in motion a number of even more terrible disasters - Cavell helps us keep the question in our minds as the play proceeds: \"Why did this have to happen?\"<br />'", "tags": null, "uri": "King Lear 21.html", "ranges": {"start": "/span[2]", "end": "/span[3]", "startOffset": 4290, "endOffset": 4417}, "annotator_schema_version": "v1.0", "user": 23, "quote": " 'CORDELIA  /    /  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What you make of the storm will largely determine your reading of the play, and so I want to introduce a few questions and ideas about it before we begin looking at this act close-up.<br /><br />The critic Charles Lamb, in his 1812 book \"On the tragedies of Shakespeare, considered with reference to their fitness for stage representation,\" wrote of this play: \"Lear is essentially impossible to be represented on a stage\" (Muir 6).&nbsp; Lamb was speaking both of the limited abilities of human actors to represent this most complex of Shakespeare''s kings, but also of the limits of theatrical artifice and of the stage itself.&nbsp; How can we believe there is a storm when we know that a boy backstage is hitting a drum, and another is spilling water?&nbsp; <br /><br />The storm has been problematic for critics ever since.&nbsp; Some, like Greenblatt, see it as a kind of cruel trick that Shakespeare plays on Lear.&nbsp; The bard gives his leading man something out of which he tries to make meaning, only to reveal to him at the end of the play (by the death of Cordelia) that his suffering has been for nothing.&nbsp; In that reading, the storm is not at all supernatural.&nbsp; Greenblatt might say something like, \"when enough water condenses in the clouds, it rains, as it does in act three of King Lear\" (this is exaggerated, of course, but I want to draw a clear distinction between what I see as two diverging approaches to the storm).<br /><br />The other reading of the storm might go something like this.&nbsp; Lear is cast out and mad, and the symbolical theatrical representation of that is to have the natural world reflect his interior state.&nbsp; Stormy man; stormy heavens.&nbsp; This is the way that theater works: by expressionistically displaying the interior life of a character through the use of theatrical artifice.<br /><br />Lamb probably tended more towards that second reading, and he read all of Lear''s trials (of which the storm is only one) as contributing to a \"living martyrdom\" of the king.&nbsp; By the end of the play, Lamb (and the audience) is waiting for Cordelia to <em>live</em> and to take control of England along with the much-abused Lear, for this is exactly what happened in Shakespeare''s sources.&nbsp; If Cordelia survives and Lear takes back his throne, the suffering he endured during the storm and afterwards would retroactively take on the significance of expiatory punishment.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yet Shakespeare denies us such a reading by killing Cordelia and Lear.&nbsp; Given that neither of these two readings seems completely appropriate, what do we make of the storm?&nbsp; Rather than offer a simplistic way to resolve this conflict, let us think of ourselves as joining the great critical debate about these scenes.&nbsp; In thinking about them, one way to gauge where you stand is to ask yourself this question:<br /><br />\"If the play began three days later, would the storm take place during act two?\"&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />'", "tags": null, "uri": "King Lear 21.html", "ranges": {"start": "/span[13]", "end": "/span[14]", "startOffset": 0, "endOffset": 17}, "annotator_schema_version": "v1.0", "user": 23, "quote": " 'SCENE I.

Here, briefly, is the controversy: the First Quarto text (1622) prints <em>Indian</em>, but the First Folio (1623) prints <em>Iudean </em>(you can imagine that, in a period of greater typographical flexibility, the two words would look very similar). Bibliographical evidence is complicated and indeterminate on both sides (a typesetter either mistaking <em>Indian </em>for <em>Iudean </em>or vice-versa is equally possible).<br /><br />The contextual arguments go as follows: <em>Indian </em>makes sense because the wealth of India (especially in gemstones) was notable in Renaissance England, and the ignorance of Indians who were unaware of the value of these gems was commented upon by Renaissance writers (hence \"base\"). On the other hand, <em>Iudean </em>makes sense because Desdemona was betrayed treacherously, and (in the Geneva bible), in betraying Christ Judas threw away \"a pearl of great price\" (Matthew 13:46). The matter remains open, but Levin''s conclusion makes sense to me: that it is appropriate for Othello to compare himself to the Indian, whose base action results from ignorance, and \"very inappropriate for him to compare himself to Judas, whose action was regarded as a conscious choice of evil.\"<br />'", "tags": null, "uri": "Othello 20.html", "ranges": {"start": "/span[20]", "end": "/span[21]", "startOffset": 15712, "endOffset": 15719}, "annotator_schema_version": "v1.0", "user": 705, "quote": " 'Indian, ", "consumer": null, "id": 4871, "permissions": {"read": null, "admin": null, "update": null, "delete": null}},{"updated": null, "created": "2008-06-29T08:18:31", "text": " 'Here is the double sense of the word \"Turk\" again: on the one hand, Othello is the brave Christian Venetian general who killed the Muslim \"circumcised dog;\" on the other hand, he himself is the malignant Turk (because he is a Moor) who betrayed the Venetian.'", "tags": null, "uri": "Othello 20.html", "ranges": {"start": "/span[20]", "end": "/span[21]", "startOffset": 15925, "endOffset": 16077}, "annotator_schema_version": "v1.0", "user": 705, "quote": " 'in Aleppo once,   /  Where a malignant and a turban''d Turk   /  Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,   /  I took by the throat the circumcised dog,   /  And smote him, thus.

Iconoclastic reformers thought that images in general, and the theater in particular, were dangerous because they drew attention away from the word--language, in the theology of radical Protestantism, was the way in which God chose to communicate, so images (and especially religious images) were inherently troubling. Early English theater was largely composed of religious plays, so reformers had their work cut out for them. Even after the public theaters opened and plays became mostly secular, the theater was seen as a place of licentiousness and ribaldry, not a place where good Christians should be on a Sunday afternoon. This controversy was in the public zeitgeist from the late fifteenth century through the middle of the seventeenth century, and would flare up periodically during changes in political or religious leadership.<br /><br />Shakespeare''s placement of what is essentially an iconoclastic pronouncement (\"the object poisons sight\") at the end of a play is, as you can imagine, a matter of much interest for Shakespeare scholars.

It''s hard to forget, after all, that in the last scene, Hamlet explained to her that \"I essentially am not in madness, / But mad in craft\" and that \"My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time, / And makes as healthful music.\" How straightforward -- Hamlet feigns madness, clues his mother in to that deception, and enlists her in his effort to keep the true nature of this \"insanity\" from Claudius. Case closed.<br /><br />Or not. It''s also hard to forget that Hamlet''s \"madness\" goes through a dizzying array of modulations and redefinitions. Polonius and Ophelia believe it; Claudius suspects it but searches for its \"source\" nonetheless; Gertrude, as we can see here, is easily swayed. Even more importantly, Hamlet himself has no idea what''s going on in his head -- and maybe Shakespeare doesn''t have any idea, either (that''s what T.S. Eliot argued in \"Hamlet and His Problems,\" his famous essay on Shakespeare''s failure to provide an \"objective correlative\" for Hamlet''s behavior). Hamlet is convinced he''s not truly mad, but he''s not convinced that he''s completely fine, either. Rather, he insists on a certain psychic impenetrability, proscribing any genuine encounter with the true nature of his anxiety. Paradoxically, Gertrude''s statement that Hamlet is as \"Mad as the sea and the wind,\" seemingly certain, just serves to remind us of the insoluble and inconclusive nature of Hamlet''s \"madness.\"<br /><br />A bit more on Hamlet''s self-knowledge (or lack thereof): Hamlet may not be plagued by madness, but any candid account of the depression from which he is suffering eludes him \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the relationship between his melancholy and his mock lunacy is even more obscure. When Rosencrantz and Guildenstern first interrogate him as to his condition in Act II, Scene II, he gives an assessment whose vagary seems at first calculated to mislead his interrogators until it becomes clear that his confusion is genuine. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will tell you why [you were sent for],\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Hamlet begins, making a show of sparing Rosencrantz and Guildenstern the need to explain themselves: \"I have of late, but / wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all / custom of exercises and, indeed, it goes so heavily with / my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems / to me a sterile promontory.\" Manifestly, Hamlet says nothing that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and Claudius and Polonius \u00e2\u20ac\u201c do not already know: he is melancholy (having \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lost all his mirth\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) and he is behaving rather erratically (having \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forgone all / custom of exercises\u00e2\u20ac\u009d). He leaves Rosencrantz and Guildenstern disappointed in their efforts to discover, as Claudius had asked them, why \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nor th\u00e2\u20ac\u2122exterior nor the inward man / Resembles that it was.\"<br /><br />Were they more perceptive listeners, though, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern might have noticed that Hamlet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather extended self-assessment gradually loses its caricatural element.

Yet Claudius is more honest than he appears; that is, Hamlet is a threat to Gertrude (the bedroom interview, anyone?) and to the state (can you imagine Hamlet at the helm of Denmark?). Shakespeare is a pretty good playwright, and here he provides ample evidence of that by having the text speak to us on three levels: a basic level (Claudius speaks and we listen); a psychological level (Claudius is clearly a lying, good-for-nothing throne-stealer and his motives are transparent); and a meta-level that transcends character (Claudius may be deceiving Gertrude and himself, but he''s also saying something intelligible and instructive that the reader is made to consider).<br />'", "tags": null, "uri": "Hamlet 5.html", "ranges": {"start": "/span[16]", "end": "/span[17]", "startOffset": 724, "endOffset": 758}, "annotator_schema_version": "v1.0", "user": 740, "quote": " 'liberty is full of threats to all; ", "consumer": null, "id": 5050, "permissions": {"read": null, "admin": null, "update": null, "delete": null}},{"updated": null, "created": "2008-07-01T09:57:11", "text": " 'Notice that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern have been completely reduced to puppets at this point -- they enter and exit without saying a word.

Who''s he imitating?<br /><br />Feste begins by insisting, as Maria and Toby have already done, that Malvolio is possessed by a demon. Therefore, in the style of an exorcist, he addresses the demon directly: \"Out, hyperbolical find!\" He uses \"hyperbolical\" to mean \"overwhelming\" (Arden suggests a comparison to \"vehement\" - from vehe (out)+mens (mind) - as a closer analogue). Feste keeps this up until line 35, and his last reference to possession begins \"Fie, thou dishonest Satan!\"<br /><br />All of the possession language takes us back to Harsnett, who, you''ll remember, was the English pamphleteer who produced, in 1603, \"A declaration of egegious popish impostures.\" This pamphlet came too late for Shakespeare to have consulted it during the composition of Twelfth Night, but from it we can infer the kinds of exorcisms that were taking place around the turn of the 17th century. Harsnett documents public, arena-style exorcisms with the intention of debunking them, showing us that the Elizabethan public would have known exactly what Feste was spoofing in these lines.<br /><br />Feste then moves on to insist that Malvolio is not possessed, but mad. When Malvolio says his house is dark, Feste tells him that it''s brightly lit, and so on, trying to convince Malvolio that \"that\" is not \"that.\" There''s an element of metatheatricality to the bay-window line, too, if we read it metaphorically. In the metaphor, Malvolio would be the audience and Feste would be the theatrical enterprise as a whole.  The nature of the theater is that the latter must forever try to convince the former that a dark room (the theater) is really a seacoast, or a castle, or a brightly lit room. <br /><br />The clown then takes up the Pythagorean theory of metempsychosis, which is the doctrine of the transmigration of souls. Malvolio answers \"incorrectly,\" saying that he condemns metempsychosis for tarnishing the sanctity of the human soul, and Feste rebukes him. Of course, had Malvolio answered any other question any other way, Feste would still have told him \"fare thee well\" - the point is to disorient Malvolio and frustrate him.<br /><br />Sprinkled throughout these lines is a satire on Puritanism itself, which is a leitmotif of Sir Toby''s scenes throughout the play. Puritanism is a Protestant theology articulated by John Calvin and others and rising in England in the 16th and 17th centuries before spreading in New England from the pulpits of Jonathan Edwards and others. The values of Puritanism which Feste pokes fun at here are its \"courtesy,\" its learnedness, and, generally speaking, what was perceived as its seriousness. Puritanism indeed valued study, charity, and discipline, but the charicature of Puritanism represented by Malvolio (and parodied by Feste as Sir Topas) is not accurate or comprehensive - it''s comic. <br /><br />To get an idea of what Puritanism sounds like, <a href=\"http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.iii.i.html\">click here</a> to read the introduction to Calvin''s \"Institutes,\" <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puritan\">here</a> to read the Wikipedia article on Puritanism, or <a href=\"http://www.apuritansmind.com/JonathanEdwards/JonathanEdwards-Sermons-SinnersInTheHandsOfAnAngryGod.htm\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"standard\">here</a> to read Jonathan Edwards''s sermon \"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God.\" Marilynne Robinson''s \"The Death of Adam\" contains an essay called \"Puritans and Prigs\" which is a good introduction to Puritanism for those familiar with the stereotype of the starchy, pointy-hatted New England sourpuss (which is to say, all of us) but less familiar with the content of the theology itself.<br /><br />John Calvin:<br /><br /><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/John_Calvin_-_best_likeness.jpg\" /><br /><br />John Whitgift, Archbishop of Canterbury during Shakespeare''s lifetime:<br /><br /><img src=\"Image%20Url%20Here\" /><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b1/Whitgift.JPG\" /><br /><br />'", "tags": null, "uri": "Twelfth Night, Or What You Will 341.html", "ranges": {"start": "/span[21]", "end": "/span[22]", "startOffset": 988, "endOffset": 2735}, "annotator_schema_version": "v1.0", "user": 23, "quote": " 'MALVOLIO.  /  [Within] Who calls there?  /    /  CLOWN.  /  Sir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio the lunatic.  /    /  MALVOLIO.  /  Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady.  /    /  CLOWN.  /  Out, hyperbolical fiend! how vexest thou this man! talkest thou  /  nothing but of ladies?  /    /  SIR TOBY.  /  Well said, master parson.  /    /  MALVOLIO.  /  Sir Topas, never was man thus wrong''d; good Sir Topas, do not  /  think I am mad: they have laid me here in hideous darkness.  /    /  CLOWN.  /  Fie, thou dishonest Satan!

It all comes back to the conflicting attitudes towards the natural world, for the savage was, from the English perspective, representative of natural man untempered by civilization. Prospero, a believer in the superiority of human art and its ability to conquer and better nature, despises Caliban. Yet the opposing strain of thought would hold that Caliban, as the representative of natural man in the play, is in fact a far better man than Prospero, being a pure product of the natural world. (This view of course assumes that the natural world is inherently good.)&nbsp;Montaigne was a great proponent of this second view.
