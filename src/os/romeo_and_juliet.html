Ah, dear Juliet,<br>Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe<br>That unsubstantial death is amorous,<br>And that the lean abhorred monster keeps<br>Thee here in dark to be his paramour?<br>For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;<br>And never from this palace of dim night<br>Depart again: here, here will I remain<br>With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here<br>Will I set up my everlasting rest,<br>And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars<br>From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!<br>Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you<br>The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss<br>A dateless bargain to engrossing death!<br>Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!<br>Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on<br>The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!<br>Here's to my love!<br>O true apothecary!<br>Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.<br></p>
