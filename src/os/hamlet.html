<p class="shkspr-speech-body">In what particular thought to work I know not;<br>But in the gross and scope of my opinion,<br>This bodes some strange eruption to our state.<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">MARCELLUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,<br>Why this same strict and most observant watch<br>So nightly toils the subject of the land,<br>And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,<br>And foreign mart for implements of war;<br>Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task<br>Does not divide the Sunday from the week;<br>What might be toward, that this sweaty haste<br>Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:<br>Who is't that can inform me?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">HORATIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">That can I;<br>At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,<br>Whose image even but now appear'd to us,<br>Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,<br>Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,<br>Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--<br>For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--<br>Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,<br>Well ratified by law and heraldry,<br>Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands<br>Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:<br>Against the which, a moiety competent<br>Was gaged by our king; which had return'd<br>To the inheritance of Fortinbras,<br>Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,<br>And carriage of the article design'd,<br>His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,<br>Of unimproved mettle hot and full,<br>Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there<br>Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,<br>For food and diet, to some enterprise<br>That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--<br>As it doth well appear unto our state--<br>But to recover of us, by strong hand<br>And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands<br>So by his father lost: and this, I take it,<br>Is the main motive of our preparations,<br>The source of this our watch and the chief head<br>Of this post-haste and romage in the land.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BERNARDO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I think it be no other but e'en so:<br>Well may it sort that this portentous figure<br>Comes armed through our watch; so like the king<br>That was and is the question of these wars.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">HORATIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.<br>In the most high and palmy state of Rome,<br>A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,<br>The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead<br>Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:<br>As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,<br>Disasters in the sun; and the moist star<br>Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands<br>Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:<br>And even the like precurse of fierce events,<br>As harbingers preceding still the fates<br>And prologue to the omen coming on,<br>Have heaven and earth together demonstrated<br>Unto our climatures and countrymen.--<br>But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!<br>I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!<br>If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,<br>Speak to me:<br>If there be any good thing to be done,<br>That may to thee do ease and grace to me,<br>Speak to me:<br>If thou art privy to thy country's fate,<br>Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!<br>Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life<br>Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,<br>For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,<br>Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">MARCELLUS</p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BERNARDO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">It was about to speak, when the cock crew.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">HORATIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">And then it started like a guilty thing<br>Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,<br>The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,<br>Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat<br>Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,<br>Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,<br>The extravagant and erring spirit hies<br>To his confine: and of the truth herein<br>This present object made probation.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">MARCELLUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">It faded on the crowing of the cock.<br>Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes<br>Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,<br>The bird of dawning singeth all night long:<br>And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;<br>The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,<br>No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,<br>So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">HORATIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">So have I heard and do in part believe it.<br>But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,<br>Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:<br>Break we our watch up; and by my advice,<br>Let us impart what we have seen to-night<br>Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,<br>This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.<br>Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,<br>As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">MARCELLUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know<br>Where we shall find him most conveniently.<br></p>

For all, our thanks.<br>Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,<br>Holding a weak supposal of our worth,<br>Or thinking by our late dear brother's death<br>Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,<br>Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,<br>He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,<br>Importing the surrender of those lands<br>Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,<br>To our most valiant brother. So much for him.<br>Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:<br>Thus much the business is: we have here writ<br>To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--<br>Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears<br>Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress<br>His further gait herein; in that the levies,<br>The lists and full proportions, are all made<br>Out of his subject: and we here dispatch<br>You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,<br>For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;<br>Giving to you no further personal power<br>To business with the king, more than the scope<br>Of these delated articles allow.<br>Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.<br></p>

Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,<br>A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,<br>To reason most absurd: whose common theme<br>Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,<br>From the first corse till he that died to-day,<br>'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth<br>This unprevailing woe, and think of us<br>As of a father: for let the world take note,<br>You are the most immediate to our throne;<br>And with no less nobility of love<br>Than that which dearest father bears his son,<br>Do I impart toward you. For your intent<br>In going back to school in Wittenberg,<br>It is most retrograde to our desire:<br>And we beseech you, bend you to remain<br>Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,<br>Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.<br></p>

I remember, one said there<br>were no sallets in the lines to make the matter<br>savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might<br>indict the author of affectation; but called it an<br>honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very<br>much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I<br>chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and<br>thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of<br>Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin<br>at this line: let me see, let me see--<br>'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--<br>it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--<br>'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,<br>Black as his purpose, did the night resemble<br>When he lay couched in the ominous horse,<br>Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd<br>With heraldry more dismal; head to foot<br>Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd<br>With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,<br>Baked and impasted with the parching streets,<br>That lend a tyrannous and damned light<br>To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,<br>And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,<br>With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus<br>Old grandsire Priam seeks.'<br>So, proceed you.<br></p>
