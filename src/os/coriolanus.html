For the dearth,<br>The gods, not the patricians, make it, and<br>Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,<br>You are transported by calamity<br>Thither where more attends you, and you slander<br>The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,<br>When you curse them as enemies.<br></p>

Your virtue is<br>To make him worthy whose offence subdues him<br>And curse that justice did it.<br>Who deserves greatness<br>Deserves your hate; and your affections are<br>A sick man's appetite, who desires most that<br>Which would increase his evil. He that depends<br>Upon your favours swims with fins of lead<br>And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?<br>With every minute you do change a mind,<br>And call him noble that was now your hate,<br>Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,<br>That in these several places of the city<br>You cry against the noble senate, who,<br>Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else<br>Would feed on one another?

They say there's<br>grain enough!<br>Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,<br>And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry<br>With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high<br>As I could pick my lance.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Both</p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Both</p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">MENENIUS</p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Both</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Well, well, sir, well.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">MENENIUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of<br>occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:<br>give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at<br>your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a<br>pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for<br>being proud?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BRUTUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">We do it not alone, sir.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">MENENIUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I know you can do very little alone; for your helps<br>are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous<br>single: your abilities are too infant-like for<br>doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you<br>could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,<br>and make but an interior survey of your good selves!<br>O that you could!<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BRUTUS</p>

</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">MENENIUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,<br>proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as<br>any in Rome.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">SICINIUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Menenius, you are known well enough too.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">MENENIUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that<br>loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying<br>Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in<br>favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like<br>upon too trivial motion; one that converses more<br>with the buttock of the night than with the forehead<br>of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my<br>malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as<br>you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink<br>you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a<br>crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have<br>delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in<br>compound with the major part of your syllables: and<br>though I must be content to bear with those that say<br>you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that<br>tell you you have good faces. If you see this in<br>the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known<br>well enough too? what barm can your bisson<br>conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be<br>known well enough too?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BRUTUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">MENENIUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You<br>are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you<br>wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a<br>cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;<br>and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a<br>second day of audience. When you are hearing a<br>matter between party and party, if you chance to be<br>pinched with the colic, you make faces like<br>mummers; set up the bloody flag against all<br>patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,<br>dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled<br>by your hearing: all the peace you make in their<br>cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are<br>a pair of strange ones.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BRUTUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Come, come, you are well understood to be a<br>perfecter giber for the table than a necessary<br>bencher in the Capitol.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">MENENIUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall<br>encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When<br>you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the<br>wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not<br>so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's<br>cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-<br>saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;<br>who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors<br>since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the<br>best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to<br>your worships: more of your conversation would<br>infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly<br>plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.<br>How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,<br>were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow<br>your eyes so fast?<br></p>

Let me twine<br>Mine arms about that body, where against<br>My grained ash an hundred times hath broke<br>And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip<br>The anvil of my sword, and do contest<br>As hotly and as nobly with thy love<br>As ever in ambitious strength I did<br>Contend against thy valour.

Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,<br>We have a power on foot; and I had purpose<br>Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,<br>Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out<br>Twelve several times, and I have nightly since<br>Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;<br>We have been down together in my sleep,<br>Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,<br>And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,<br>Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that<br>Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all<br>From twelve to seventy, and pouring war<br>Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,<br>Like a bold flood o'er-bear.

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but<br>Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,<br>Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;<br>And you are darken'd in this action, sir,<br>Even by your own.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">AUFIDIUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I cannot help it now,<br>Unless, by using means, I lame the foot<br>Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,<br>Even to my person, than I thought he would<br>When first I did embrace him: yet his nature<br>In that's no changeling; and I must excuse<br>What cannot be amended.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Lieutenant</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Yet I wish, sir,--<br>I mean for your particular,--you had not<br>Join'd in commission with him; but either<br>Had borne the action of yourself, or else<br>To him had left it solely.<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">AUFIDIUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I understand thee well; and be thou sure,<br>when he shall come to his account, he knows not<br>What I can urge against him. Although it seems,<br>And so he thinks, and is no less apparent<br>To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.<br>And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,<br>Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon<br>As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone<br>That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,<br>Whene'er we come to our account.<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">AUFIDIUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">All places yield to him ere he sits down;<br>And the nobility of Rome are his:<br>The senators and patricians love him too:<br>The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people<br>Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty<br>To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome<br>As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it<br>By sovereignty of nature. First he was<br>A noble servant to them; but he could not<br>Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,<br>Which out of daily fortune ever taints<br>The happy man; whether defect of judgment,<br>To fail in the disposing of those chances<br>Which he was lord of; or whether nature,<br>Not to be other than one thing, not moving<br>From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace<br>Even with the same austerity and garb<br>As he controll'd the war; but one of these--<br>As he hath spices of them all, not all,<br>For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,<br>So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,<br>To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues<br>Lie in the interpretation of the time:<br>And power, unto itself most commendable,<br>Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair<br>To extol what it hath done.<br>One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;<br>Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.<br>Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,<br>Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">COMINIUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I offer'd to awaken his regard<br>For's private friends: his answer to me was,<br>He could not stay to pick them in a pile<br>Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,<br>For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,<br>And still to nose the offence.<br></p>
