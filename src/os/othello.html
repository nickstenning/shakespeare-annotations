<p class="shkspr-stagedir">Enter RODERIGO and IAGO</p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">RODERIGO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly<br>That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse<br>As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">IAGO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">'Sblood, but you will not hear me:<br>If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">RODERIGO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">IAGO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,<br>In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,<br>Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,<br>I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:<br>But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,<br>Evades them, with a bombast circumstance<br>Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;<br>And, in conclusion,<br>Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,<br>'I have already chose my officer.'<br>And what was he?<br>Forsooth, a great arithmetician,<br>One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,<br>A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;<br>That never set a squadron in the field,<br>Nor the division of a battle knows<br>More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,<br>Wherein the toged consuls can propose<br>As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,<br>Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:<br>And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof<br>At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds<br>Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd<br>By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,<br>He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,<br>And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">RODERIGO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">IAGO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,<br>Preferment goes by letter and affection,<br>And not by old gradation, where each second<br>Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,<br>Whether I in any just term am affined<br>To love the Moor.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">RODERIGO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I would not follow him then.<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">IAGO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">O, sir, content you;<br>I follow him to serve my turn upon him:<br>We cannot all be masters, nor all masters<br>Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark<br>Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,<br>That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,<br>Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,<br>For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:<br>Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are<br>Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,<br>Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,<br>And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,<br>Do well thrive by them and when they have lined<br>their coats<br>Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;<br>And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,<br>It is as sure as you are Roderigo,<br>Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:<br>In following him, I follow but myself;<br>Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,<br>But seeming so, for my peculiar end:<br>For when my outward action doth demonstrate<br>The native act and figure of my heart<br>In compliment extern, 'tis not long after<br>But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve<br>For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">RODERIGO</p>

</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">IAGO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Call up her father,<br>Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,<br>Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,<br>And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,<br>Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,<br>Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,<br>As it may lose some colour.<br></p>
</div>

Do not believe<br>That, from the sense of all civility,<br>I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:<br>Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,<br>I say again, hath made a gross revolt;<br>Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes<br>In an extravagant and wheeling stranger<br>Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:<br>If she be in her chamber or your house,<br>Let loose on me the justice of the state<br>For thus deluding you.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus<br>or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which<br>our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant<br>nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up<br>thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or<br>distract it with many, either to have it sterile<br>with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the<br>power and corrigible authority of this lies in our<br>wills. If the balance of our lives had not one<br>scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the<br>blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us<br>to most preposterous conclusions: but we have<br>reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal<br>stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that<br>you call love to be a sect or scion.<br></p>

I have professed me thy<br>friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with<br>cables of perdurable toughness; I could never<br>better stead thee than now. Put money in thy<br>purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with<br>an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It<br>cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her<br>love to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he<br>his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou<br>shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but<br>money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in<br>their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food<br>that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be<br>to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must<br>change for youth: when she is sated with his body,<br>she will find the error of her choice: she must<br>have change, she must: therefore put money in thy<br>purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a<br>more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money<br>thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt<br>an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not<br>too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou<br>shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of<br>drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek<br>thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than<br>to be drowned and go without her.<br></p>
