O, I have suffered<br>With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,<br>Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,<br>Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock<br>Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.<br>Had I been any god of power, I would<br>Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere<br>It should the good ship so have swallow'd and<br>The fraughting souls within her.<br></p>

He being thus lorded,<br>Not only with what my revenue yielded,<br>But what my power might else exact, like one<br>Who having into truth, by telling of it,<br>Made such a sinner of his memory,<br>To credit his own lie, he did believe<br>He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution<br>And executing the outward face of royalty,<br>With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--<br>Dost thou hear?<br></p>
