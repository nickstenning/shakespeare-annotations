Enough; no more:<br>'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.<br>O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,<br>That, notwithstanding thy capacity<br>Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,<br>Of what validity and pitch soe'er,<br>But falls into abatement and low price,<br>Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy<br>That it alone is high fantastical.<br></p>

'Cast thy humble slough,' says she;<br>'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants;<br>let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put<br>thyself into the trick of singularity;' and<br>consequently sets down the manner how; as, a sad<br>face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the<br>habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have<br>limed her; but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me<br>thankful! And when she went away now, 'Let this<br>fellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio, nor<br>after my degree, but fellow. Why, every thing<br>adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no<br>scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous<br>or unsafe circumstance--What can be said? Nothing<br>that can be can come between me and the full<br>prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the<br>doer of this, and he is to be thanked.<br></p>

I have your own letter that induced<br>me to the semblance I put on; with the which I doubt<br>not but to do myself much right, or you much shame.<br>Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little<br>unthought of and speak out of my injury.<br>THE MADLY-USED MALVOLIO.'<br></p>
